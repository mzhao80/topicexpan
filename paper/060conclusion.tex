In this paper, we study the problem of topic taxonomy expansion, pointing out that the existing approach has shown limited term coverage and inconsistent topic relation.
Our \proposed framework introduces hierarchy-aware topic term generation, which generates a topic-related term by using both the textual content of an input document and the relation structure of a topic as the condition for generation.
% In brief, the training step optimizes the unified neural model to maximize the total likelihood of the initial topic taxonomy given a text corpus, then the expansion step discovers new topics at each valid position in the topic hierarchy by collecting confident phrases generated by the trained model.
The quantitative and qualitative evaluation demonstrates that our framework successfully obtains much higher-quality topic taxonomy in various aspects, compared to other baseline methods.  

For future work, it would be promising to incorporate an effective measure for the topic relevance of multi-word terms (i.e., phrases) into our framework.
%, for the sake of accurate consideration of the semantic relevance between each topic and topic-related terms.
Since learning and utilizing the representation of multi-word terms remains challenging and worth exploring, it can be widely applied to many other text mining tasks.
