2	Mr. Speaker I rise to nominate Kevin McCarthy for Speaker of the House Mr. Speaker there has been a lot of talk about history over the last few days 1856 was the last time it took longer than 9 votes to find a Speaker of the House It took 133 votes over 2 months Without question the issues that divide us today are much less severe than they were in 1856 In fact there is far more that unites us than divides us regardless of our political party or ideology The issues today are over a few rules and personalities while the issues at that time were about slavery and whether the value of a man who looks like me was 60 percent or 100 percent of a human being It was a long drawn out painful process but it needed to happen In the end Nathaniel Banks won by the slimmest of margins But the margins don t matter when your policies are on the right side of history On that day long ago the good guys won On that day long ago the abolitionists won On that day the people who believed in freedom and self determination won The leading Republican nominee won then and the leading Republican nominee will win again today Since then our Nation has made a lot of progress That includes families like mine My family has gone from slave to the floor of the United States House of Representatives being the first Member of his freshman class to speak In a series of five generations my family has gone from slave to right here since 1856 My father and mother were born in the 1940s and 1950s in the Jim Crow South and my dad lived directly across the street from a school he couldn t go to because he was Black He started a business with one truck one trailer no excuses with the help of his wife and now his son stands here on the precipice of taking back the majority for the American people and taking this Nation in the right direction I am a freshman I have only been here a couple of days but I have heard a lot of D C politicians tell me about how broken D C is I don t need D C politicians to tell me how broken D C is The American people have already told us how broken D C is by giving the Republicans the majority so we can fix this mess We will counter the socialist movement of envy and confiscation with a conservative movement of access and opportunity We will stand on the right side of history again We will end the growth of government and we will stop 87 000 new IRS agents from picking through your pocketbooks We will secure our energy independence We will ban the sale of petroleum from our strategic reserves to China We will establish a bipartisan select committee specifically to keep our eye on the ball in China We will address the crisis at the border that is killing Americans by the day and improve both our safety in our Nation and our dignity for those who come here in search of a better life But not yet We are still stuck at the starting block The American people have told us by putting a Republican majority here that they want Republicans to lead and they want a government that works and doesn t embarrass them We are failing on both missions and that must change today Benjamin Franklin said We must hang together or we will most assuredly hang separately We are stuck in a malaise at an impasse and we will stay here and not be able to fight the real conservative fight until we find a way to come together and fight that mission together Yesterday we experienced very briefly our first win It was a small victory It was a small victory but didn t it feel good We have been working hard for that victory and there are much more to come As a cadet at West Point I learned the phrase that has always been my motto throughout my life Mission first people always Right now the people are left out Right now they don t have a Congress to speak for them at the highest level of government Right now every individual in this room can concede that the rounds that we have taken are not what we told our constituents we would do We told them that we would fight the opioid crisis For perspective there is a hallowed monument that my father took me to My father is a Vietnam veteran This monument has a total length of 500 feet nearly 2 football fields It is 10 feet high and the letters are only a half inch with 58 000 names for a war that lasted years According to the CDC in 2021 we lost almost twice as many people as we lost in Vietnam to overdoses We lost 600 Americans to overdoses since Tuesday We are talking about the debt rising You can t count how many dollars we have spent of our great grandchildren s money since Tuesday The work we promised the American people we would do we are welching on that promise But I have hope I have hope that we will be able to come together unified and put the right person in leadership From many one e pluribus unum I am standing here today because I am the seventh Member to stand up in support of Kevin McCarthy for Speaker He has earned my trust The first time we met was in his office under the watchful gaze of a Frederick Douglass painting He told me in that office on the eve of the 2019 State of the Union address that there is nothing that could be said or done during that address that embarrassed him more than the fact that when the Democrat side stood up they would look more like the United States of America than we do He set out not to compromise our values not to compromise our ideology but to work harder to make sure that more people with diverse perspectives and different lived experiences could be here In the very next election he won 14 seats up from 199 All the seats he won were with minorities women and veterans The very next cycle this next cycle he helped me and my good buddy and classmate the Congressman from Texas Wes Hunt double the number of Black Republicans in the Republican Conference We have a long way to go but we have come so far We have come so far We can t quit We can t quit You don t fire a guy who is winning Look at the Governor s mansions and legislatures we lost across the country just this past cycle and look at the gains that Kevin McCarthy has made uphill getting the gavel as minority leader in half the time The mainstream media likes to laud the leadership of Nancy Pelosi Kevin McCarthy won the gavel back as minority leader in half the time going uphill We want to talk about people who can win I am a Lions fan and I am well acquainted with snatching defeat from the jaws of victory We need to learn how to win We need to learn how to take victory With Kevin McCarthy s leadership he has given us victories on rules He has given us victories on keeping costs down He has given us victories with winning the majority back I am so proud to be a part of the majority making class He has earned my trust and hopefully he will earn your trust He has got 90 percent of us in the Conference When is the last time any of us had 90 percent approval ratings Kevin McCarthy you will see up there has over 90 percent approval ratings If you really want to start making history let s do it the right way We need a conservative fighter to help this country get back on the right track but the first thing we need to do is elect Leader McCarthy as Speaker of the House I am ready to make history and I know you are I am excited to work with each and every single one of you because we have a job to do At the direction of the Republican Conference I advance the name of Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House for the 118th Congress
3	Mr. Speaker I rise to nominate Hakeem Jeffries of New York for Speaker of this House Mr. Speaker I speak on behalf of the Democratic Caucus when I say that there is no victory in adjourning without doing the business of the people Mr. Speaker House Democrats are united behind a champion of expanding and protecting the right to vote Since the beginning of 2021 21 State legislatures have passed 42 restrictive voting laws Hakeem has stood up against voter suppression in the new Jim Crow era every step of the way As we begin a new Congress we need a leader who believes in strengthening democracy who understands that to cast a vote is a sacred responsibility that should be afforded to the many not the privileged or the select few Hakeem understands that in order for us to be a more perfect Union we can t deny the voices of individuals in the democratic process Mr. Speaker today we affirm our support of the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act Mr. Speaker that is why I am directed by the Democratic Caucus to advance the name of Hakeem Jeffries from New York as Speaker
4	Mr. Speaker I rise to place in nomination the name of Byron Donalds of Florida I will begin by saying how much I have anticipated the arrival of the gentleman from Michigan Congressman James in this House not in the Senate not in the old staid unchanging Senate but in the House where we make change Yesterday we could have elected the first Black Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Hear me clearly Had the cascade of votes begun it would have extended to every Member of this body It could begin today Last night I sat within feet of Mr Donalds as the tweet of another Member elect appeared on the screen That Member elect wrote and sent out to America that Byron Donalds is a prop I have spent a good bit of time with Mr Donalds especially lately He ain t no prop If he were a prop he wouldn t be sitting where he is sitting This is the tired old grotesquely racist rhetoric that we have seen far too long Today a Member elect quote tweeted a FOX News story that incorrectly reported that I said that if I don t prevail on the question before the House I will resign That Member elect quote tweeted that incorrect story for his own political purposes after the story had been corrected and the actual statement contradicting that report had been provided This is the old trafficking in lies from Washington that the American people know far too well And by the way I am not leaving Kevin McCarthy released to the public on New Year s Eve a document entitled Restoring the People s House and Ending Business as Usual To his great credit Mr McCarthy made a statement of huge significance to the country The nominal leader of a major party acknowledged publicly that this institution is broken and he committed to make changes to fix it So let me help my colleagues in the majority understand We are doing the people s business That is what these 3 days have been about We are committed to make changes to this institution that has lost its way It is epitomized in the 1 7 trillion omnibus rammed through this institution just 2 weeks ago I say to my colleagues that I came to fix this broken system America has seen that problem for a very long time too The commitment to change it is new The genesis of the prospect of changing it emerges from this moment and those since June that led at long last to the New Year s Eve statement of Mr McCarthy and to these 3 days on the floor America needs men and women of courage to do something new in Congress so that Congress can serve the American people The Lord said Behold I do a new thing We need more Byron Donalds I know Byron He is not a prop He is a man of personal conviction He arrived at his convictions through authentic and genuine life experience People ask me what is the endgame How does this end The answer to this question is that this is a dynamic process All of the decisions on this floor result from the coming together of minds one way or another This is the people s business We will resolve the people s business and when we do we will go to the mat for the American people because we will be led by people of conviction like the gentleman from Florida Byron Donalds

6	Mr. Speaker I rise to nominate Kevin McCarthy for Speaker of the House I think at this point we have all heard about Kevin McCarthy at length He is my friend my colleague I am very proud to say that I know our remarks are directed toward the Clerk and the Chair but I don t mind saying that I am directing my remarks to another part of my team And make no mistake we are a team We are together I would say this to some of my friends in Texas I have the same fear truly that some of you have that we squander this opportunity to right the wrongs that have gone on here for the last 2 and 4 years and there are very real wrongs I have that fear just like you do I would say to my friend from Montana that I have the same fear you do that America gives us this chance to change our course and that we fail I have that fear I would say to my friend from Arizona I have the same fears that you do that we don t recover from the indifference that has been shown to the honor we have to serve here to the responsibility we have to safeguard our Constitution and the freedoms of Americans I have that fear that it can t be recovered from I would say to my friend the general from Pennsylvania that I have the same fears that he has that we squander what our brothers and sisters in arms have sacrificed for I stand differently because of sacrifice My friend from Texas Mr Crenshaw when he looks out at the world he sees the world differently because of what he sacrificed for My friend Jim Baird when he extends a hand he extends it differently because of what he sacrificed for during his service in Vietnam We have so many in this body that gave so much sacrificed so much to support and defend the Constitution of our United States I fear that we don t live up to what some of our friends and brothers and sisters in arms have very literally given their lives for I don t mind saying that on occasion that absolutely brings a tear to my eye because it does It is not for that My friend from Texas my colleague Mr Roy he and I have stood on this floor together arguing on the same team about life and death issues for the United States of America with so few people in here that you could hear an echo That is sad That is not living up to our friends I have sat in classified briefings with the general from Pennsylvania minimally attended on both sides with issues that absolutely matter to the safeguarding of every person within our borders and our servicemembers abroad We can do better than that and we will I would say to my friends those issues that we deal with like that that you have spoken passionately about I have heard your speeches I have sat and listened to them They can t be fixed by our friend Andy and they can t be fixed by our friend Kevin or our friend Jim or our friend Byron That comes from inside each and every one of us to change what we prioritize to change how we choose to spend our time given this opportunity this honor to serve in this place My friend Mr Roy has been very proud of the number of individuals that are in here saying that this is how the process should play out and I totally agree with him on that But we don t control whether individuals in here are sitting on their cell phones scrolling through whatever social media or whether they are actually paying attention to the issues The Speaker can t change that That is up to the individual That is something that we have to look at each other and sharpen each other and make each other better When we started this process months ago behind closed doors as leadership for the minority was being chosen behind closed doors leadership for the majority was being talked about and debated and chosen behind closed doors I said to my friend Mr McCarthy Please don t look at us and see me as your friend or all of us as your friends Don t look at us and see us as your colleagues Don t look at us and see us as individuals that are votes for Speaker of the House Look at us as individuals that are looking out to our communities our neighborhoods our friends our neighbors and our country and telling them that we vouch for you because that is what we are doing We are vouching for you and I couldn t be more proud to stand here today and vouch for you my friend I vouch to my community that Kevin will do as he has promised He will give us the opportunity to right the course He will give us the opportunity to vote He won t control how every individual votes but he will give us the opportunity to make sure that we have smart energy policy between the Atlantic and the Pacific that makes sense for Americans to make sure that he protects our border protects Americans to make sure that we don t spend what we don t have on a credit card that we don t spend wastefully I am vouching for my friend that he will give us that opportunity to make sure that we don t have endless terms here in the House of Representatives I vouch that he will deliver that opportunity to us I am proud to stand before my country and say that Kevin McCarthy is different He is different That is why for those that I was speaking to earlier the process is where it is today He is different He is not Paul Ryan He is not going to tell you that you will get a term limits bill and then you won t He is not Mitch McConnell He fought against the 1 7 trillion wasteful spending package that was sent to us on Christmas Eve eve That is not him He is different He is not John Boehner He didn t throw you all that disagreed with him out on your cans and say I don t want to hear from you I don t want to listen to you He welcomes everybody in because he is different If we give him the chance to be our Speaker we will all be different He will be different this Congress will be different and our country will be different I stand before you today and say at the direction of the Republican Conference I advance the name of Kevin McCarthy very proudly as the next Speaker of the House
7	Mr. Speaker I rise to nominate Hakeem Jeffries as Speaker of the House Mr. Speaker 212 212 212 212 212 212 and today 212 212 House Democrats stand united behind our leader because Hakeem Jeffries stands united for the American people The historic dysfunction that we are seeing this intraparty fight that the American people have been drawn into is imperiling our national security It will imperil the ability of this government to deliver basic services It is imperiling our jobs and our responsibility to serve our constituents but it is also entirely predictable They are failing to convene Congress today but for years they have failed to deliver the votes for the American people When schools and small businesses needed to reopen and the American people wanted vaccines they said no When we capped insulin costs for seniors at 35 a month they said no When we lowered healthcare costs and premiums for working families they said no When we defended the civil rights of LGBTQ Americans they said no When we protected lives from senseless gun violence especially in the wake of the horrors of Buffalo and Uvalde they said no When we stood up for women and reproductive freedom they said no When we brought manufacturing back to America they said no When we answered the urgent call to protect our planet and invest in clean energy and create tens of millions of good paying jobs they said no When we said women deserve equal pay for equal work they said no When we said that childcare and paid family leave should be available to every worker in this country to every family they said no When we secured the fundamental right to vote for every single American they said no When we stood by our veterans and expanded their access to healthcare they said no When we defended our democracy 2 years ago tomorrow from a tyrannical President following the January 6 insurrection they said no House Democrats will stand together We will stand for the American people It is our job and our responsibility to elect a Speaker who stands with them and with great pride I nominate Hakeem Jeffries
8	Mr. Speaker I rise to place into nomination the name of my friend from Florida Byron Donalds for Speaker of the House You know we are coming off an election just 2 months ago a little less than 2 months ago actually What did that election tell us Well there were 5 million more Republicans who cast their ballots and told us that the American public wanted a change They wanted a change from the policies of the left that has taken over the Democratic Party It said they wanted a change a change from this administration this administration that has inflicted so much pain economically We have seen crime explode We have an administration that won t even acknowledge that there is a crisis on the border I tell you to go on down to the border I have invited this administration to come with me to the border Let s see it firsthand The American public said they want a change They want something new They want something different and we are on a path that just continues Where were we just 12 years ago An 11 trillion national debt Do you know where we are today Almost three times that Both parties share blame in that We have to bring that under control You bring that under control not just by changing the rules of an institution but by changing the leadership I am told this process is painful It is embarrassing I am told Do you know what it is It is not dysfunction and it is not imperiling What it is is the exchange of ideas and expression of support for people you want to be your leader in the next Congress I think it is incredibly healthy actually for the American people to see that we are on the floor something that my colleagues across the aisle so rarely like to be They enjoy the proxy voting I guess They have sat there I will give it to you They have laughed and they have chuckled and they have pointed fingers at us and said oh see here But do you know what As my friend from Florida just said we are together We are having an internal fight It is being displayed I wish it wasn t necessarily being displayed but the American people can see it But I can tell you this When this is over and done with I know which side of the aisle is going to be laughing and it is going to be the side that is unified in taking on the issues that Americans care about the issues that the other side has not only ignored but has put upon the American people We used to be energy independent It seems so long ago It was 2 years ago actually We are going to restore American energy independence Do you know how you reduce inflation You stop devaluing your currency You stop blowing out the waters by spending 1 7 trillion on an omnibus bill that has many thousands of earmarks in it You start taking on crime You start fighting violence You start fighting the overgrowth of our budget and restore our economy You start incentivizing jobs You recognize that the American middle class is being squeezed and that those who are in more difficult economic circumstances are being squeezed by an economy that has this inflation that attacks energy You bring your border back under control and this side is going to bring that border security under control We recognize it is a crisis It is a crisis when in 2020 the Yuma sector had 9 000 encounters not for a 5 day period but for an entire fiscal year Under this administration with these policies 9 000 encounters is about a 5 day period in the Yuma sector today You don t know what it is like unless you see that happening We are on a suboptimal path It has to change To make a change it can be difficult It can be short term uncomfortable But when you move to the correct path all of a sudden things ease up and you can start having success The direction here in my opinion is to someone like Byron Donalds a man who is living the American Dream and is an example and a mentor for millions who need hope Here is a man who has worked his way up He is not a novice He has the experience He has the chops to be the Speaker He is a man who has a lovely family and they are politically engaged They know what is going on He has worked in Florida politics He has worked in the legislature He has respect He has the quiet confidence that a leader needs I look around this body today I know it is hard for you to believe and it is hard for me to believe sometimes when I am here as I have the great honor and privilege of serving with you but you represent the cross section of America the great American experiment The experience that you bring and the knowledge that you bring is unique The road to recovery is through this body I believe if you want to make changes you have to make changes Maintaining the status quo is not an option today I believe we have reached an existential crisis in this country I look across the aisle and I see the left has captured virtually every institution It is time that we reassert ourselves and put America back on the road to recovery The person who I think is most capable and will do the most credible job to lead us back that way is my friend from Florida the Honorable Byron Donalds who I am pleased and proud to nominate as the next Speaker of the House of Representatives

10	Mr. Speaker I rise to nominate Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy has been our leader for the past 4 years and has overwhelming support within this Conference My intent today is to address the American people who have been watching these proceedings and are concerned about what they have seen in this Chamber over the past 2 days I am a Member of the House Freedom Caucus and I am proud to say so I believe the 20 Members that have nominated an alternate candidate have expressed their concerns with leadership and many of those concerns have been addressed and accepted by Leader McCarthy and this Conference I believe this battle we are waging must end Kevin McCarthy fully understands that being Speaker of the House will not be easy Kevin is aware that any legislation he would like to pass out of this House will require support and enforcement from the Freedom Caucus This is where I believe we can hold the Speaker accountable Kevin has made changes to the House rules at the request of all Members One of those rule changes was the motion to vacate the chair which Nancy Pelosi removed 4 years ago to avoid the scrutiny and the accountability The motion to vacate the chair which has not been offered for a floor vote in over 100 years calls for the removal of the Speaker of the House Kevin has reinstated the motion to vacate the chair which I believe was the right thing to do This motion allows us the Republican Conference to hold the Speaker accountable The American people gave us my friends us the Republicans the majority and their vote of confidence to change the direction of our country The American people are begging for leadership because the Biden administration certainly has not placed the American people first Kevin McCarthy understands He understands he must protect that Speaker s gavel and abide by the will of the American people The decisions we make in the 118th Congress are critical to the future of our country The decisions we make the legislation we pass as a Republican majority must have the support of the American people We have a crisis on every corner in America and the American people are expecting Republicans to bring this much needed change We must come together today and implement that change To those of you outside of Washington that are watching Kevin McCarthy and this Republican majority understand your pain We understand your pain We feel it We understand we must secure our southern border We must unleash our energy sector and become energy independent We must curb inflation by reducing spending and we must support our law enforcement officers We have to get crime under control We must place America and its people first I say to my friends on the Republican side that we can do all this while holding the Biden administration accountable and the Washington bureaucrats who have infringed and abused the rights of the American people and their families long enough Under Speaker McCarthy they will be held accountable They will be held accountable Today let s do what is in the best interests of the American people Let s get to work Let s elect Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House Mr. Speaker at the direction of the Republican Conference I advance the name of Kevin McCarthy as the next Speaker of the House for the 118th Congress
11	Mr. Speaker I rise today to nominate Hakeem Jeffries for Speaker of the House Vote after vote Democrats stand united and ready to work on behalf of the American people under the leadership of Hakeem Jeffries Vote after vote nomination after nomination Democrats are united just like we were united when we passed the American Rescue Plan to get our economy back on track united when we passed the infrastructure law to rebuild America united when we capped insulin at 35 passed historic gun safety legislation and passed the PACT Act to help our Nation s veterans united when Democrats passed the CHIPS and Science Act to bring manufacturing back to America united when Democrats passed the Inflation Reduction Act to reduce our deficit and protect our environment Democrats are unified to tackle the climate crisis while Republicans are mired in their own leadership crisis Mr. Speaker House Democrats are ready willing and able to get to work for the American people We will do so under the leadership of Hakeem Jeffries who has a plan for the American people Therefore as vice chair of the Democratic Caucus I am directed by the vote of our Caucus to present for election to the office of Speaker of the House of Representatives for the 118th Congress Representative elect from the State of New York Hakeem Jeffries
12	Mr. Speaker I rise to nominate the name of Byron Donalds as Speaker of the House of Representatives Let me begin by stating that it is an absolute privilege to be here standing and serving with each and every one of you I know we have differences of opinions and I know we have differences of agendas that we would like to pursue but I will tell you that we are all representing the United States of America in the best fashion that I know that we truly believe in So thank you and it is a privilege When I walk out every evening from the Longworth Office Building I will tell you that as I look back on the Capitol with the lights gleaming upon it that I recognize the honor the privilege and the responsibility that each one of us has taken on to be in this place that we are right now and the obligations that we have to the districts that we represent back home It is an incredible privilege but it is also an incredible responsibility I do not take it lightly and I know that no one in this room does We are participating in a system that has endured 247 years through drought and through flood through world wars and through a civil war In some way we return to this place year after year to serve the people of the United States of America Unfortunately over the past 15 years the process that we use has been dramatically broken The voices that were sent here to equally equally represent each of the 435 districts across this Nation have become diminished This through the consolidation of power into the hands of the Speaker and a fortunate few who happen to serve on the Committee on Rules which controls every aspect of legislation that travels through this body The debate and the discussion have been all but eliminated and the balance of us are left to vote yes or no Those are our options That is what has led to the disintegration of the relationships that we see across this floor That is not equal representation which is guaranteed by our Constitution and expected by our constituents We have had more discussion and debate over the last 3 days than I have participated in on this floor for the last 2 years It is healthy It absolutely promotes the collegiality that everyone is striving to obtain We are having discussions not just within our own party but amongst each other as we walk around and start planning for the legislation that we will need to address over the next 2 years in the 118th Congress that sooner or later yes sooner or later we will begin to function as Those are the good days And guess what Our constituents think as they watch us on C SPAN today that this is how every day functions They think that this is how every bill gets addressed in this body They will be shocked to learn the ones that you have not disclosed this little nasty secret to that unfortunately that is not how it works around this place That under the current rules and under the current leadership construction that on fly in days typically Monday at the beginning of the week the leadership on both sides of the aisle negotiate a number of bills 15 to 20 pieces of legislation that one Democrat and one Republican stand on this floor they discuss momentarily and then they say the magic words Without objection we will pass this by unanimous consent There are two people standing on the floor passing pieces of legislation that oftentimes are the naming of buildings that don t really bother anybody or affect one s life but in many circumstances spend millions and tens of millions of dollars that the taxpayers are obligated to cover and their Representative was not even here to vote upon it That my friends is wrong It is wrong So yes we need to have change We need to fix this broken system Several of us have taken it upon ourselves to fly in and object to those very bills not because we are objecting to the bill but just to force them to be brought out into the daylight so that everyone can hear about those bills to force people to come out and vote up or down for those bills as their constituents believe that they are doing right now That is just one of the little secrets and it demonstrates again how broken this system is Last summer we began to negotiate a group of us in good faith a list of changes amendments to the rules of this body not to empower ourselves not to bring personal benefit to ourselves but to empower you and you and you Maxine and you and you and everyone sitting in this Chamber equally There are no rules I did not use anyone s name Everyone should be excuse me Maxine
13	I will Mr. Speaker Thank you So that everyone will have equal representation equal representation for the districts that elected them These are not radical deviations from the norm These are a restoration of the rules so that this place can function properly Things like single subject legislation that most statehouses utilize right now so that we don t have 4 000 page documents that we are given a matter of hours to review that are filled with many subject matters that are trillions of dollars in cost rules like germaneness so that you can actually bring an amendment forward on the floor as long as it pertains to the bill that was originally being addressed an open rule process again so that each individual here can participate in the thing that we were sent here to do to help collaborate and craft legislation and work together that is what we were sent here to do These are commonsense amendments that would restore the process and give each of us an equal voice This is how we are going to secure the border that everyone now I do believe has recognized that there is a problem with This is how we are going to regain energy dominance again which is not just an economic issue It is a national security issue This is how we are going to reduce the inflation rate by working together but we cannot call it working together if you cede all of that power to the hands of a few Hoping for this change will not create this change Change is uncomfortable We understand that It is not unachievable and we must make change in this broken system We must The current leadership that is in place will continue and support the use of earmarks in this body and that is the golden trail to corruption It is a way to buy votes and spread money around this body from places outside of this city that leads to bad legislation and bad decisions The current leadership I was told I should not be so concerned with these suspension bills that get passed every week because now they have made an amendment We keep hearing about these amendments and the concessions that were made The concession was that they will not ask for anything to be suspended that costs more than 100 million Now I don t know about the neighborhoods that you live in but in the neighborhood that I live in 100 million is a lot of money My constituents expect me to vote upon 100 million bills and 80 million bills and 10 million bills so that they know what in the world is in them and what is going on and they do not expect them to be passed by unanimous consent with no one on the floor I made a living developing property and as many of you probably know it takes a while to take a piece of ground from bare earth to a community My mother God rest her soul came out to one of my projects I had just opened it up and it had been 2 years since the time I had bought the property By the time we went out I had a nice entrance built The streets were built and the streetlights were there They were just starting to build homes She said My goodness Matthew You must really be pleased to finally see your project coming up out of the ground I said No Mom Actually I am pleased that everyone else can see it because I saw it 2 years ago when I first walked out there Well I have a vision for this place that we can restore regular order so that each of us may have the ability to represent our districts and our constituents equally as we move through this process Then at that time we will be able to call it truly the people s House again I have been here just 2 years and I have watched Byron Donalds during that time and previously as he proudly served in the Florida Legislature I can tell you this He is a man of intellect he is a man of integrity and he is a man that I am proud to nominate as the next Speaker of the House of Representatives
14	Mr. Speaker I rise to nominate the gentleman from Oklahoma Mr Hern as Speaker of the House Mr. Speaker we have been accused of not having a plan Well we have presented many plans and are even presenting two plans simultaneously right now for Speaker of the people s House I sat in my chair anticipating to vote for Byron Donalds whom I respect whom I see as a leader and there was a gut check that said we need someone that is going to convince my colleagues on this side of the aisle that it is time to get going It is time to build momentum Many of you have said it You see that Kevin McCarthy does not have the votes You are understanding that he is not going to get there We had the votes for him I cannot produce those anymore The colleagues that I brought with me to offer those 218 votes on the first ballot aren t there anymore It is not happening As it has been said we need to get to a point where we start evaluating what life after Kevin McCarthy looks like America doesn t want more talk and I am going to keep my speech a little short They want action I will take that I want to get to work too America is tired of rhetoric and they want results This isn t chaos This is a constitutional republic at work I am a mom of four boys I know what chaos and dysfunction look like This is actually a really beautiful thing to be here with all of my colleagues debating Just as the gentleman from Montana said we have not experienced this in the 2 years that we have served here in Washington D C This is the most debate that has taken place and I love it I love the conversations that are going on on the floor in the Cloakroom and in the Halls There is nothing extreme There is nothing unreasonable We are trying to get this right As my conservative colleagues and I have stated time and time again Congress is broken and fundamentally needs change I am here to get this right We need a leader that is not of the broken system someone who is not beholden to the lobbyists but to the people who sent us here someone who can unite our party and most importantly someone who can deliver on the promises that we have all made to the American people I believe that there are many people on the floor today that can do just that I voted for my friend Jim Jordan I voted for my friend Byron Donalds I am voting for Kevin Hern the gentleman from Oklahoma Mr Hern went from rags to riches Like myself and many other Members he is a small business owner He has lived the American Dream He is a father a family man and as Kevin likes to say he is a conservative but he is not mad about it We can have a happy warrior leading us I understand that threats have been made about committee assignments that you won t receive committee assignments if you do not vote for Kevin McCarthy That is true it happened in Conference That is exactly what we were told but we don t govern in fear We govern for the people on principle Don t be afraid to do the right thing I believe that Kevin Hern is a unifier He just received the chairmanship of the Republican Study Committee by unanimous consent This is the largest caucus in our Conference Look how many people have already put their trust in Kevin Hern to lead them I get asked by my constituents Where does this go Who can unify the party Who can deliver results Representative Kevin Hern can do just that and I am proud to enter his name into nomination and I hope that some of you join me

17	Mr. Speaker I rise again to nominate Hakeem Jeffries for Speaker of the House Mr. Speaker I thank my colleague on the other side of the aisle for sharing his American Dream story and to his family for being with him at his side It is our hope that this Chamber gets down to the business so he and all the new Members in this Chamber can be sworn in to do the work of the people That is why House Democrats stand united again on this ballot to make sure that Hakeem Jeffries is the lead vote getter in this Chamber It is also why it is important just as I relayed a few days ago Mr. Speaker the importance of the character of Hakeem Jeffries who he is his story and why he should be given an opportunity to lead this Chamber In New York after the fifth grade you can t get on a bus to go to school anymore You have to take alternate means You can walk or you can take a train In sixth grade Hakeem and his brother would walk to the train station take the train get off the train and walk to school Now there is a little disagreement in the Jeffries household as to how many days his father took him on that route before he let him navigate that route with his younger brother The character it takes for an older brother in sixth grade and his fourth grade little brother to go to school each and every day in New York to be on their own to handle themselves and to handle each other that is the character of this man That is the character of a leader you want in this Chamber He is going to be the one who walks with you who sees you through the day who makes sure your priorities are his priorities And at the end of the day when it is just you and he he is going to make sure we all do the business of this body and we all get home for our families There is nothing more important than the work that we do in this Chamber for the American people safeguarding priorities like Social Security and Medicare making sure that our families are taken care of making sure that the families in our communities are taken care of What we have seen in this Chamber is tough It is tough to watch It is tough to imagine what would happen in this Chamber today if we were debating Social Security and Medicare What would happen What would the votes be Where would people stand That is why it is important that Hakeem Jeffries leads this body On behalf of the Democratic Caucus I am nominating the leader of the governing party in this Chamber Hakeem Jeffries from New York
18	Mr. Speaker I rise to nominate Byron Donalds as Speaker of the House Mr. Speaker I have known Byron for roughly about 4 years now and being that he is from the State of Florida I can tell you that I have come to know him on both the campaign trail and personally But I want to clarify something real quick to my colleagues across the aisle What you are seeing with this discussion does not mean that we are dysfunctional And in no way shape or form will a Democrat ever hold the gavel to a Republican controlled House These discussions and dialogue have actually been good for the American people And although the media tries to pit us against each other I can tell you that it has been something that we need as a country There are people that are frustrated with this process Byron through this entire time has done something that leaders should do more of and that is listen respect people when they are talking understand the needs of the American people be willing to negotiate but also realize when it is proper to stand your ground on certain things I ask my colleagues today to support him I think he is an incredible representation of what this country is and that is exactly why he has my vote for Speaker of the House
19	Mr. Speaker I rise to nominate Kevin Hern for Speaker of the House It is as simple as that Let s start getting somewhere with this realize the fact that Kevin McCarthy does not have the votes Let s elect a Republican who can unify our Conference who is a true leader I am casting my vote for Kevin Hern and I hope you will as well

21	Mr. Speaker I rise tonight in the spirit of 1923 to address the House Mr. Speaker I rise to nominate Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House Mr. Speaker first let me express my deep appreciation and the appreciation of everybody in this room for the work you are doing Our Clerk has stepped up and reflects our House s best tradition of preparation and dedication to this institution and we are grateful From the first Speaker of the House the Honorable Frederick Muhlenberg to the one who will be elected next Kevin McCarthy the role of Speaker of the House is one of the most beloved in American history The Speaker s mission is to carry out the principled goals and objectives of his or her party while at the same time protecting this institution and the traditions of the people s House all the while remaining faithful to that imperative in our preamble of the Constitution to promote the general welfare It is a difficult job that takes a special personality with deep affection for the House robust courage a sense of humor and great amounts of humility and patience I have watched Kevin McCarthy for longer than my 8 years serving in this Chamber and I can say without hesitation that Kevin has brought these foundational traits of leadership to bear for the good of this institution and for the good of the American people It is said that a nation not in control of her finances cannot control her destiny and I agree From our many conversations over many years I have no doubt that our next Speaker Kevin McCarthy agrees In the Republican Commitment to America Leader McCarthy charged our Republican Conference with taking on his two biggest concerns facing this world and this Nation China and our domestic national debt and deficit Over the past 2 years we have lost our way on spending printing too much money at our central bank and spending here in Congress like drunken sailors This bad policy palooza went into overdrive in the past 2 years with some 5 trillion in new spending demanded by President Biden and now delivered by the House minority whose own budget chair famously said that there is effectively no limit to what America can print borrow and spend Of course this is madness and it is not anchored in any economic tenet and there is not a single one of us here who isn t demanding a return to fiscal discipline And who can deliver fiscal discipline Kevin McCarthy On the point of spending let me show you Mr. Speaker a list of everyone who has written me in the Second Congressional District who has asked me to cut spending I am holding up a blank piece of paper No one has asked me to cut spending in writing and there are not many people who get a lot of mail in this House to cut spending and to set spending priorities In contrast we get hundreds of letters asking us to increase spending But we are at a critical point in this Nation s fiscal health and there is one person to help see us through it Kevin McCarthy How do I know Because he has said it himself and he has identified how to do it In 2018 then Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy brought a balanced budget amendment to the floor of this House Mr McCarthy said by our actions we have shown Washington s spending problem can t be boiled down to a lack of will It is a problem of structure and process and everyone knows the process of government funding in Washington is broken He went on to say that when you change structure you change behavior and that no matter what we know that if the structure set up by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 has only worked to its successful completion four times in 44 years then we have nothing to lose by making big changes That is your next Speaker on the floor of this House in 2018 Kevin McCarthy is committed to making big changes We have heard it in our conference meetings We have heard it in our rules debates We know this includes reforming the budget process fighting to bring all 12 appropriations bills to the floor under regular order and on time and crafting changes to structurally rein in spending in this House These changes will bring sanity back to our fiscal process I am committed to bringing sanity back to the fiscal process and I hope every Member on this floor will be and follow Mr McCarthy s lead Much has been said by my friends on the other side of the aisle my good friends the so called popcorn caucus this week if you will over the past few days about 1923 and we are having a robust discussion here among House Republicans as to who will be the next Speaker of the House Back in 1923 the insurgency among Republicans then was from the center left of the Republican Party Today it is from the center right But there is more to the story in that fight 100 years ago and I want to remind my friends of that history When Fred Gillett was elected Speaker on the ninth ballot in 1923 the outcome was a more robust more unified Republican Conference one that would go to work with President Calvin Coolidge cut government spending balance the budget and cut taxes while paying down the debt House Republicans 100 years ago unleashed a pro growth agenda House Republicans under Speaker Kevin McCarthy will unleash a pro growth agenda to get this economy moving That pro growth agenda benefited families in the 1920s The McCarthy pro growth agenda will benefit families across this country today A century later under the next Speaker Kevin McCarthy mark my words this party will come together to unleash American energy make the Trump tax cuts permanent rein in runaway government spending and fight for a balanced budget So I stand today with unqualified support to nominate my friend the next Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy
22	Mr. Speaker I rise to nominate Hakeem Jeffries for Speaker of the House Mr. Speaker we have heard a lot today yesterday and the day before about the potential history that may be made in this Chamber But it is worth repeating to the American people watching the history that has already been made by the elevation of the dedicated talented passionate and committed public servant and leader from the State of New York the first African American and the first person of color to lead any political party in the House of Representatives in the history of our country and that is Hakeem Jeffries Mr. Speaker it is with great pride that I rise to nominate the gentleman from New York the man who has been the lead vote getter 10 times and counting to be the Speaker of the House Mr. Speaker the last several days have been difficult for the country and for the American people as they have watched what has unfolded in this Chamber and as they have seen the dysfunction laid bare on the other side of the aisle I suspect that some Americans watching will recall the dysfunction of years past My colleague on the other side of the aisle talked about history Woodrow Wilson Calvin Coolidge and the like Mr. Speaker I would like to take you through a more recent history because I can tell my friends that as a Member elect from the great State of Colorado this is not their first rodeo as far as dysfunction is concerned Four years ago today I was sworn in with my colleagues from the class of 2018 during what became the most difficult and the longest government shutdown in the history of our country Why Because of the dysfunction and the chaos on the other side of the aisle The country then did what it has so often done it looked to House Democrats to govern and to lead and under the leadership of one of the greatest Speakers in the history of the country Nancy D Alesandro Pelosi that is exactly what we did If we want to talk about history then let s talk about recent history Two years ago tomorrow I stood here with so many of my friends in this Chamber as our democracy was attacked as our colleagues on the other side of the aisle tried to overturn an election And the country yet again did what it has done before it looked to House Democrats to lead and to govern That is exactly what we did when we certified the election and we safeguarded the transfer of power So here we find ourselves again in unprecedented times in the early days of the 118th Congress The first time in over 100 years in which the House of Representatives is unable to organize because the House Republican Conference cannot select a Speaker It is a sad day for this institution but the country will do what it has done before It will look to House Democrats to govern and to lead and under the leadership of Hakeem Jeffries that is exactly what we will do Now we have heard from so many over the course of last 3 days about the wisdom the leadership and the talents of this extraordinary leader from Brooklyn But let me say why I believe that he is the person for this moment Centuries ago our Nation s second President John Adams laid bare his fear that Members of this body would gain influence by meanness not greatness by ignorance not learning Hakeem Jeffries leadership is rooted in greatness and not meanness It is rooted in learning and not ignorance His approach is rooted in common sense and not the empty and jaded cynicism and noise that we see so often in our political sphere He is a leader for our times which is why I believe he is the leader for this time The bottom line I say to my colleagues is this it is 6 30 p m here in Washington D C The House of Representatives this sacred institution needs a leader It needs a Speaker It needs a leader who will inspire us a leader who knows that our best days are yet ahead and a leader committed to our communities our Constitution and our country I am here to say that leader is Hakeem Jeffries of the great State of New York Mr. Speaker it gives me great honor as the chairman of the House Democratic Policy and Communications Committee to nominate Hakeem Jeffries for Speaker of the House
23	My friends when Donald Trump was President taxes were cut regulations were slashed energy was abundant wages were rising capital was returning from overseas to fund the dreams and ambitions of our fellow Americans and the economy was roaring What a contrast to what we have seen from this administration now I rise to nominate Donald Trump for the position of Speaker of the House For all of the vitriol that we hear from the media and at times the left there were great moments of bipartisanship under the Trump Presidency The Democrat nominee for Speaker knows that well because he led valiantly on the efforts for criminal justice reform and I was honored to join him I know no matter who is sitting in that Speaker chair we have got a lot of work to do on that very issue We took a first step but there is a second step and a third step to take I am glad that we were able to work with President Trump with Republicans and with Democrats to provide real outcomes for Americans to create greater prosperity and more opportunity I also care deeply about President Trump s focus on our Nation s veterans It seems for far too long on the campaign trail veterans were disregarded forgotten about When we would get elected to office their issues would not always rise and get center stage but we were able to pass veterans accountability measures We were able to actually get people fired at the VA who weren t doing their job What a great thing that would be to extend to continue and to continue to nourish President Trump oriented our views on trade so that we actually put the American people first not foreign interests abroad or special interests here at home President Trump knew that we had to confront China that China had already engaged in a trade war against us but it was a war that we were surrendering and so we started to fight back He stood with our farmers On foreign policy we stopped trying to find a new Jeffersonian democracy to build out of sand and blood and Arab militias in the Middle East As a matter of fact President Trump I believe is the first President in my lifetime who didn t start any new wars This is an issue that I know unites some elements of the right and left for the benefit of our communities This government for far too long has been deeply corrupt This town has been deeply corrupt The way people get leadership positions and chairmanships and opportunities to be able to morally preen has been by accepting lobbyist and special interest money and redistributing that money as currency for favors That is not a criticism of either political party It is a criticism of what we have allowed to happen in this place If we just go next man up on our side of the aisle we will reify that corrupt system and we will abandon the people who are expecting us to fight for them I have heard from my colleagues about all the important work we have to do and it is my sincere fear that if we were to allow Mr McCarthy to assume the Speakership that would not get done that it would be business as usual and the very same things that have paralyzed progress for both parties would continue to shackle us to never ending failure We can be better than that We can raise our gaze indeed We also have to restore to the Speaker s office an actual person that ought to be in the Speaker s office not the squatter who is currently there If the Architect of the Capitol is listening I have sent a letter I would like to know what the basis is to allow somebody to occupy the Speaker s office who comes in second place 10 straight times Is there some basis in law or rule or precedent for that I nominate President Trump because we must make our country great again and he can start by making the House of Representatives great again
24	Mr. Speaker I rise for the purpose of placing a name in nomination What a privilege we all are enjoying tonight we are all enjoying as elected Members of this great body the people s House as it has been said What a great representation of the constitutional Republic in which we enjoy living the greatest country in the history of the world as we play out as the people s Representatives in selecting the all important position of the Speaker of the people s House I was out on the southeast balcony here just a few moments ago looking out at the Supreme Court looking at the flag flying above this Capitol Building looking at the Jefferson and Madison both Virginians by the way Library of Congress buildings and pausing to do what probably most of us recognize we fail too often to do to take it in this high privilege this distinct honor that we have to be the people s Representatives from our respective districts in this House here in this Congress This is the greatest Nation in the history of the world With all of our imperfections as people and as a Nation no nation in the history of the world has freed more people has rescued more people has ministered to more people has evangelized to more people than the United States of America And that would be a good time to respond with some applause There is a reason why people from all over the world are trying to get into this country many of them illegally due to the policies of the current administration People from all over the world are literally taking on a treacherous journey risking life and limb subjecting themselves to abuse to try to sneak their way into our country because they know this is the greatest country in the history of the world No country in the history of the world has provided more upward mobility more advancement opportunity to people of all races all nationalities all ethnicities like the United States of America However we as a Nation we are teetering on the brink aren t we Isn t there just a window of opportunity to save the Republic Crisis after crisis 32 trillion in national debt which equates to over 90 000 per citizen almost 100 000 now per citizen some 300 000 per household When I said that on this very floor a few months ago in a budget debate the then chairman of the Budget Committee said Stop saying that we are not asking anybody to pay it back as if it is not real as if it is Monopoly As I heard someone say don t tell the other side what happens after trillion what comes after trillion We just spent 1 7 trillion both parties Republicans joining in the Senate a few in the House to pass a 1 7 trillion omnibus spending bill Sadly and unfortunately part of the reason why I stand here today that was the kind of bill that has been supported by our former minority leader every time it has come up in the House no matter who was in control in the 12 years that he has been in leadership contributing to the 32 trillion in national debt Yes the other side is better at raising the debt than we are but we have been participants We are in crisis We are in crisis with 5 million illegals having invaded the border in the last 2 years When is it too much We are in crisis with the state of our education system K 12 college campuses indoctrination of our kids We are in crisis with the weakening of our military with these NDAA bills We are in crisis with trampling on our most basic and essential freedoms over the last 2 years in ways we couldn t have imagined pre 2020 Whether we can assemble whether we can worship whether we can earn a living whether we can travel what we have to put on our face what we have to take into our body whether or not we have to disclose what we have taken in trampled in ways we couldn t have imagined just a few years ago The greatest reflection of where the people in the country are is the House of Representatives and the people spoke back on November 8 and gave the majority by some 3 or 4 million votes to the Republican Party It is not the White House it is not the Senate it is the people s House that reflects where the American people are and they have trusted us on this side of the aisle with the leadership of this House We have a window of opportunity to validate that trust to do whatever we can to save the Republic to earn them giving us the Senate and the White House and this House back in 2024 We have got to have a leader who not only has true conservative convictions that reflect the majority of Republicans who sent us here but yet a courageous leader It doesn t matter what you believe by the way unless you are willing to take risk to yourself personally to fight for it We need a leader who has proven to do that very thing We have an opportunity to make history We will live

40	Mr Speaker again thank my friend from Oklahoma for yielding Mr Speaker we are here to discuss the rules of the House actually to debate the rules package Why this is so important is because this lays out the ability for the House to conduct business for the House to not only conduct business but for the House to address the problems that the American people across this country face Let s just be very clear up front We saw a lot of debate about this last week At the heart of all of the discussions last week was very clear surely from our side that Washington is broken Not just is Washington broken but the way that this House has been running for the last few years has not been designed to address the problems of the people across this country In fact we have seen many of the problems that families are facing across America created by the things that have come out of this Congress signed by President Biden Why is inflation running away Because spending is out of control because bills appear by dark of night bills that nobody has read that are thousands of pages long where Members aren t even allowed to give input in committee or on the floor to address problems they know their constituents will face if these bills pass Yet the bills are passed because they are written in rooms behind closed doors by a small number of people not concerned about the consequences that will affect so many millions of people across this Nation Mr Speaker for a long time we have been saying this needs to change In fact we ran on an agenda to change the way that Washington works to fix this broken system to get our country back on track and we were awarded the majority by the people across this country Today starts that process of fixing what is broken in Washington so that Washington can finally start working for the people of this country who are struggling Let s start with one basic thing reopening the people s House For years the American people were shut out of coming and seeing their government work In fact with proxy voting which by the way ends in this rules package Members of Congress have to show up and work again Just look at the bill that passed a few weeks ago the omnibus spending bill 1 7 trillion mostly borrowed from countries like China You look at all the things that had absolutely nothing to do with the general operations of government that were thrown in that Now you can start looking at it today but you surely couldn t look it the day of the vote because very few people had an opportunity to read it over 4 000 pages dumped by dark of night right before the vote Yes a majority of this Congress voted by proxy on that bill They weren t even here showing up to vote You know what Americans all across the country have to show up to vote They have to go to their worksite They can t work remotely In fact Congress doesn t work virtually It is just not set up that way Yet that is what we have seen the last 2 years committees that don t even meet in person There are some committees that haven t had an in person hearing for 2 years We end that practice in this rules package where committees actually have to get to work again not only meeting in person but in some cases going out into the field going into the real world places like the border between United States and Mexico where yes despite the President s claim there is a crisis at the border We have been talking about it for a long time We have been trying to bring legislation but that legislation has been rejected by a top down structure This rules package changes that so we can finally start bringing bills to the floor to address things like the border crisis to finally start addressing inflation and runaway spending If a Member of Congress has an idea and they want to bring an amendment to the floor for so long they were shut out of that ability We had a bill that was over 4 trillion in spending and taxes that was brought through multiple committees in Congress and not one amendment was allowed to be brought forward and passed In fact even the majority was told in the committees Don t allow a single amendment to pass on a bill dealing with trillions of dollars in taxes and spending that is crushing families across America Let s make Congress work for families again Let s empower Members of Congress to be able to represent their constituents We were all elected by on average about 750 000 people For too long each of the Members of Congress Republican or Democrat were denied the ability in so many different ways because the rules were structured to shut their ability down from representing their districts unless they were in a leadership position That has to change and under this rules package that finally does change Let s make this Congress work for the people who sent us here We are after all the people s House It is about time we start acting like it Let s pass this rules package get to work addressing the needs of the American people Mr Speaker I urge passage of this important piece of legislation
41	Mr Speaker I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma Mr Cole for yielding me the customary 30 minutes and I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr Speaker first let me congratulate our incredible new House Democratic leadership team Hakeem Jeffries Katherine Clark and Pete Aguilar It is a dawn of a new day here in Congress as a new generation takes on the solemn responsibility of leadership Leader Jeffries has been tireless in his work to put people over politics His steady leadership as chair of our Democratic Caucus uniting our Members harnessing their talent and diversity and fighting tirelessly to make life better for American people is a source of inspiration for me and so many others It is also a privilege to be here with my good friend Tom Cole someone who I respect greatly and who I know greatly respects this institution We sit on opposite ends of the dais but I admire Mr Cole s leadership and the example he sets Even when we don t see eye to eye I am proud of our work to build an atmosphere of respectful dialogue on the Rules Committee We have done so not just among our Members but among our hardworking staff and I thank our minority and majority staff led by Don Sisson and Kelly Dixon for all of their hard work I look forward to working with Mr Cole and his team this Congress to continue our collaboration on issues of shared concern Mr Speaker as Leader Jeffries put it so succinctly this weekend our Republican friends campaigned on the claim that they would fight against inflation and fight for the American people Instead all they have done is come to Washington and fight with each other In fact what has become crystal clear over the past few days is the extent to which the Republican Party has been hijacked by an extremist MAGA faction a faction not interested in governing but in their own egos a faction not interested in compromise but in their own power a faction not interested in putting people over politics but instead interested in putting their own political ambition over the people we serve Now here we are nearly a week later considering their deeply flawed rules package the first legislation on the floor by this new majority and they are using it to gut the Office of Congressional Ethics attack women s access to abortion make it easier for big oil companies to pollute and interfere in ongoing criminal investigations into President Trump They are making it easier for billionaires and big corporations to avoid paying their taxes Is that part of their contract with America Is that their big plan to help everyday people Because most people who read this package would think it must be a joke What I am concerned about is not just what is written down here I am concerned by the backroom deals that Speaker McCarthy made with the Freedom Caucus in exchange for their votes Like Republican Congresswoman Nancy Mace said just this weekend We don t have any idea what promises were made This is unconscionable We are only 1 week into this and this is how they are running this place There is a report out by Punchbowl News and let me read it It said There is also a secret 3 page addendum that McCarthy and his allies hashed out during several days of grueling negotiations with the House Freedom Caucus This pact includes the most controversial concessions McCarthy made in order to become Speaker three seats on the Rules Committee for conservatives freezing spending at FY 2022 levels a debt ceiling strategy coveted committee assignments and more Is that what the Majority Leader meant when he talked about a new day and transparency These rules are not a serious attempt at governing They are essentially a ransom note to America from the extreme right The same Members of Congress who held this body hostage last week are the ones who ran interference for the January 6 insurrectionists who tried to overturn a free and fair election Even the new Speaker of the House voted to overturn the 2020 elections We couldn t even get a public acknowledgment from him on the 2 year anniversary of that horrific day not even a tweet It is clear that Republicans welcomed the election deniers into their ranks with open arms and now they are reaping what they have sown The insurrectionists are in charge I am reminded of the words of President Kennedy In the past those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside The American people get it They rejected extremism in the last two elections That is why they picked Joe Biden and that is why the red wave turned into a pink splash My Republican friends still aren t listening and in fact they are still empowering the extremists Don t take my word for it Let s go through their rules package They are giving a single Member the ability to remove the Speaker at any time letting a small far right faction hold their leadership hostage They are trying to shut down criminal investigations into the former President s wrongdoing They are making it easier to slash taxes on billionaire corporations while dismantling the social safety net They are giving committee chairs unbalanced discretion over which witnesses can testify rejecting pandemic safety procedures like remote voting trying to force an end to congressional staff unionization and the icing on the cake a new subcommittee to push QAnon conspiracies and launch fake investigations into nonexistent scandals What is next a rule requiring we all wear tinfoil hats This package is disrespectful not just to this institution but to the people who sent us here to govern Mr Speaker I urge a no vote and I reserve the balance of my time
42	Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume I begin by thanking my good friend from Massachusetts for his leadership of the Rules Committee over the last 4 years While we certainly haven t always agreed we have tried to always be agreeable while working with one another I certainly associate myself with his remarks about the terrific work of the staff on both sides of the aisle for helping us facilitate the operation of the House over that 4 year period I look forward again to working with my friend in the years ahead Mr Speaker I rise today to offer the rules resolution that will govern the House during the 118th Congress Determining the rules we will follow is one of the first and most consequential decisions we must make as a body at the beginning of each Congress In many ways the Rules of the House of Representatives serve to demonstrate where our priorities and values lie as an institution Make no mistake the priorities of the new Republican majority are fully on display in this resolution First and foremost Mr Speaker we are taking action to reopen the people s House and ensure that we the people s elected servants are here in Washington D C doing our jobs For far too long the House allowed Members to do their jobs from home without ever setting foot in Washington What started out as a pandemic accommodation lasted far longer than necessary but today even President Biden admits that the pandemic is over It is time for the House of Representatives to return to our normal operating procedures and it is time for the Members of Congress to actually show up to work Today s rules package eliminates proxy voting and puts an end to remote committee proceedings We restore the requirement for committees to establish plans for how they will conduct much needed oversight Republicans have robust plans to ensure that we will hold the Biden administration accountable for its actions but being a counterbalance to the administration will not stop there With today s rules package we will also establish a new select subcommittee modeled on the Church Committee to investigate the radical left s weaponization of the Federal Government in recent years We will also modify the jurisdiction of the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic to ensure we investigate the origins of the virus and finally look into the financial and societal impacts of shutdowns We will establish a Select Committee on Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party to respond to threats posed by the CCP ensure economic competitiveness for America and protect human rights Other important changes in this resolution are those that are designed to address our out of control spending problem which the former majority made vastly worse last Congress In fact when Democrats were in control of this Chamber they spent so much money through partisan bills that they managed to drive this country into an inflationary crisis Those aren t my words those are the words of former Clinton Treasury Secretary Larry Summers The American people elected Republicans to get our fiscal house in order and get our fiscal house in order we will That starts with making key changes to House rules to ensure we will instill some fiscal sanity in Congress These changes reflect a return to budgetary rules that were in place for over a decade before Democrats removed them We will restore the CutGo rule which requires us to offset any increase in mandatory spending with a corresponding cut in mandatory spending No more will the House be able to use budget gimmicks and tricks to pretend increases in mandatory spending are paid for when they actually are not We will restore a requirement for a three fifths majority to approve any tax rate increase If this rule had been in place the House would not have passed the massive tax increases the Democrats included in last year s reconciliation bill We will eliminate the so called Gephardt rule which allows the House to automatically suspend the debt ceiling upon passage of a budget resolution Just as the American people have to live within their means so too should the Federal Government Automatically suspending the debt limit may be the easy and expedient way but on a matter as important as the national debt limit what is easy and expedient is hardly appropriate The American people expect us to make a decision on the national debt limit only after full and fair consideration and debate in the House That starts with ensuring it will receive a separate standalone vote on the floor Finally we will remove the rule that allowed Democrats to simply ignore budget estimates for bills dealing with the COVID pandemic or climate change Although it may sound controversial to my friends on the other side of the aisle Republicans cannot and will not thrust our heads in the sand and ignore the effects of out of control Federal spending Mr Speaker I could go on and on but on the whole I am very proud of today s rule package It reflects Republican priorities and the priorities of the voters who elected us It reopens this institution and ensures that all Members will be in Washington to do their work as our constituents expect It ensures that we will hold the Biden administration and the Chinese Communist Party accountable It ensures that we will get our fiscal house in order Mr Speaker I urge all Members to support the rules package and I reserve the balance of my time
43	Mr Speaker I include in the Record a Congressional Budget Office report from today titled Estimated Budgetary Effects of H R 23 the Family and Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act This nonpartisan report says that the GOP s IRS funding bill will add 114 billion to the national debt so when people talk about taking steps to reduce the national debt I am not sure what they are talking about From the Congressional Budget Office January 9 2023 Estimated Budgetary Effects of H R 23 the Family and Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act Summary The Statutory Pay As You Go Act of 2010 establishes budget reporting and enforcement procedures for legislation affecting direct spending or revenues The net changes in outlays and revenues that are subject to those procedures are shown above The Congressional Budget Office adheres to laws and Congressional rules concerning the federal budget and to a set of principles called the Scorekeeping Guidelines created by the Congress Those principles guide how the House and Senate Budget Committees the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget attribute budgetary effects to legislation with the goal of promoting consistent treatment of estimated effects among those agencies For more information on those guidelines see Congressional Budget Office CBO Explains Budgetary Scorekeeping Guidelines January 2021 www cbo gov publication 56507 When a provision in an authorization bill provides funding for administrative or program management activities such as when the IRS receives additional funding for administrative activities spending of those amounts can result in increases in receipts Guideline 14 however directs scorekeepers to exclude those increases when estimating the budgetary effects of proposals that would provide additional mandatory funding for such activities Guideline 14 was adopted in part to avert cases in which possible but uncertain receipts were used to offset near term increases in spending resulting from the same bill That guideline is asymmetrical however That is even though increased receipts cannot be credited to a bill that would increase administrative funding estimated receipt losses that might result from a decrease in such funding are included in the estimated budgetary effects H R 23 would rescind unobligated funds provided by paragraphs 1 A ii 1 A iii 1 B 2 3 4 and 5 of section 10301 of Public Law 117 169 CBO estimates that the bill would decrease outlays by 71 billion and decrease receipts by 186 billion over the 2023 2032 period Both of those effects are included in accordance with Guideline 14
44	Mr Speaker Americans across the country sent a resounding message at the ballot box They support the right to access abortion and for people to have the basic freedom to make decisions about their own bodies with medical professionals and without the interference of extremist politicians In every State where abortion was on the ballot the American people called for freedom and bodily autonomy Now House Democrats first action of the 118th Congress is to answer that call If we defeat the previous question today the House will take up my bill the Women s Health Protection Act which will guarantee abortion rights for everyone in every State In the wake of the extremist Supreme Court s devastating decision last summer in Dobbs Congress must stand up for the rights of every person to be able to make decisions about their own bodies and their own futures House Democrats trust people not politicians to make decisions about their health and lives Mr Speaker I urge my colleagues to join me in defeating the previous question
45	Mr Speaker let me just say at the outset Mr Cole has probably had the hardest job in Washington the past 4 years Being the ranking member of the Rules Committee is a difficult position He has done it extremely well so I know he is going to excel as the chairman of the Rules Committee during this term of Congress Clearly Mr Speaker the American public spoke with a clear voice They want the Nation to go in a new direction They want a path away from tax and spend politics advanced by the Democrats in the last Congress In this rules package we have laid out how we intend to accomplish just that The era of legislating for the few at the expense of the many is over This new majority today begins this serious task in ways that will make this Congress more transparent more accountable and more accessible to the public and the Members that serve the institution This majority will implement voting procedures on the floor so that recorded votes can be conducted in a straightforward manner rather than what we have seen over the past 3 years that literally strands Members of Congress on the floor for hours when they cannot do any other work in their committee or anywhere else Mr Speaker I believe our friends in the previous Congress squandered their opportunity by focusing on the politics of division instead of what we were all sent here to do and that is the people s business Tackle inflation tackle lawlessness the threats abroad these are the urgent issues that the American public demands that their Representatives address Instead Americans were treated to the petty and divisive agenda of the last Congress Thankfully Mr Speaker Republicans will utilize this majority Republicans have proposed an agenda that will address these vital issues and put our Nation back on track to fiscal prosperity With this Republican majority we offer Americans a governing agenda that will ensure that the 21st century remains an American century
46	Mr Speaker if there was any overriding issue of clarity in the last election it was that Americans feel strongly that they should have the freedom to make their own healthcare decisions not politicians Apparently House Republicans weren t listening because just 2 months after a record number of Americans voted to vehemently oppose the GOP s efforts to criminalize abortion care in this country we have today a set of rules that will make their extreme agenda a reality These rules will pave the way for the immediate passage of not one not two but three bills that will limit women s rights to reproductive care Mr Speaker 25 percent of their initial agenda is anti choice This is not what the American people want Sixty one percent of this country strongly support a women s right to abortion care Mr Speaker I urge all of my colleagues to stand up to this extremism and stand up for the people who we were elected to serve Vote no on the previous question to bring up the Women s Health Protection Act and vote no on the rule Let s listen to our constituents
47	Mr Speaker I thank the chairman of the Rules Committee and my friend from Oklahoma for yielding me the time and for the experiences we have had on Rules in the last year Mr Speaker for far too long Democrats have run roughshod over the norms and practices of the people s House weaponizing our rules to insulate themselves and protect their allies in the Biden administration from proper oversight That ends today I thank the chairman Speaker McCarthy and our leadership for spending countless hours putting together this package that better reflects the historical practices of this institution while receiving feedback to ensure the work we do is by the people and for the people There are numerous items that I truly believe are vast improvements from the previous 2 years but I will focus on three First and foremost this package finally ends the ludicrous pandemic procedures that have done lasting if not permanent damage to this institution Legislating requires us to see each other eye to eye in order to understand where the other is coming from Remote proceedings and a locked down Capitol have reduced this institution to a computer screen and the work product has deteriorated as a result It is long past time for us to get back to work Second the rules package finally creates a more transparent process by which we legislate As then Chairman McGovern once said a lousy process leads to bad legislating Today through a mandatory 72 hour rule we allow more thoughtful and deliberate consideration that will improve what we pass out of this House Finally this rules package helps restore some fiscal sanity Over the past 2 years the American people have been hindered by out of control spending by the government and now our constituents are saddled with trillions in debt and the highest inflation levels in a generation House Republicans today will once again ensure the Federal budget operates like any other requiring offsets for any additional spending increase eliminating budget gimmicks and requiring inflationary analyses of the bills we consider Mr Speaker I am proud to stand by my friend and colleague from Oklahoma in support of this package and I urge Members to do the same
48	Mr Speaker let me just remind my friends that over a million Americans died of COVID including a Member elect who was supposed to be sworn in in the last Congress These remote procedures undoubtedly saved lives of Members and staff here in this Chamber So please let s not diminish what the point of all that was about Mr Speaker I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Washington Ms Jayapal
49	Mr Speaker after a week of chaos we now have a rules package for MAGA extremists attacking our freedoms and every major responsibility of this body from paying America s bills to funding our government This package criminalizes abortion by advancing bills that attack access and healthcare without a single hearing or markup undermining women s economic freedom and bodily autonomy Mr Speaker as one of the one in four women across this country who have had an abortion I join those in both parties and the majority of this country who are saying Not on our watch This package also reinstates a CutGo policy that gives wealthy corporations more tax cuts and strips the right for congressional workers to unionize It eliminates our wins to strengthen witness disclosure requirements for conflicts of interest and exempt climate change and pandemic relief from senseless paygo rules Democrats delivered for the people Republicans now want a package that works for the wealthiest few Vote no
50	Mr Speaker I come to talk today about getting back to the basics This place has in fact been broken and a number of the rules that we worked on were to bring authority back and bring us back to the principles of Jefferson s parliamentary practice and procedure his manual on that I would say to the ladies and gentlemen that we should look at that document for what its principles stand for What it stands for is and it says right in the preamble Jefferson writes For some of the most familiar and experienced members referencing they are members of parliament because that is what he based it on that nothing tended more to throw power into the hands of administration and those who acted with the majority of the House of Commons than a neglect of or departure from the rules of proceeding that these forms as instituted by our ancestors operated as a check and control on the actions of the majority and that they were in many instances a shelter and protection to the minority against the attempts of power So when I go out there Mr Speaker and ask that we change these rules to make sure that we have rules that help protect all Members including the minority Members you can imagine my surprise and shock today when I hear that they are opposed to rules that do some very basic things things that the American people are going to be shocked that we don t already do such as a single purpose rule that you cannot introduce a bill that doesn t have a single purpose or theme to that bill That can be complicated but it has to have an overarching theme something that this bill is attempting to do right from the get go The sole purpose rule Mr Speaker then there is the germaneness coming up with a stricter germaneness interpretation As we know that also helps so that you don t end up having happen what we had happen last summer where somebody introduces a bill to mint a commemorative coin and it turns into the Inflation Reduction Act That is absolutely ridiculous Hundreds and hundreds if not thousands of pages came out of a one paragraph bill No That is wrong Mr Speaker this allows us more power to say no on the floor by the individual Members
51	Mr Speaker I appreciate the additional time that the gentleman yielded to me As you can tell I get fired up about these issues The bottom line is that this rules package is the best rules package of either party in a number of years because instead of worrying about what might happen next week this rules package worries about the future of the United States Congress It is a good package and I wholeheartedly support it
52	Mr Speaker after 4 days and 15 rounds of votes the new Republican majority has finally chosen a Speaker Their first order of business is to trample on the hopes of the people that elected them The rules package that we see before us contains no less than three bills that strip people in this country of their reproductive freedom These bills are a slap in the face to voters who proved time and time again at the polls last year that they believe in reproductive freedom and abortion access From Kentucky to Kansas to my home State of California our constituents believe that the right to make decisions about their life and their health including about abortion lies with them not with you not with me not with any elected official This rules package is meant to help this body govern not restrict the personal autonomy of millions As one who has had an abortion I know how horrific this rules package is It is our bodies It is our choices Mr Speaker this dysfunction and hypocrisy is shameful and the people deserve better
53	Mr Speaker quite a little bit of the national narrative over the last week has been about Republican disunity and some have tried to apply that narrative to this rules package I get it I get it It makes for a good story but it just isn t so I rise today Mr Speaker with a more accurate assessment This rules package is actually about Republican unity This package except for one single change is the same rules package that was released two weekends ago This is the same rules package except for one single change that the Republican Conference had widespread agreement on weeks ago There are a tremendous number of conservative wins here At least 72 hours for Members and the public to review legislation before we vote on it Requiring every bill to deal with only a single subject Getting rid of proxy voting Bringing back the Holman rule which will allow this body to target specific spending line items And then the return of CutGo so that spending increases have to be offset by spending reductions Mr Speaker every single one of these big conservative wins and many more like them were supported by the Republican Conference long before the excitement of last week Today s rules package is actually proof of Republican unity and it is proof that we are committed to bringing increased accountability transparency and fiscal responsibility for this Chamber and for our country
54	Mr Speaker when Roe v Wade was overturned the impact on Americans was swift and devastating Women were denied healthcare Doctors were threatened with criminal charges Hospitals were forced to put their own liability over patients lives As the GOP doubled down on its plan for a national abortion ban the American people saw it for what it was anti women anti choice anti family and anti freedom Kansas California Kentucky Michigan Montana and Vermont voters across the country rejected this extremism With this anti freedom agenda exposed some of my Republican colleagues started to scrub their websites rolled back their rhetoric and dodged questions on abortion But here we are again in this rules package within days of taking over the House majority Republicans are pushing legislation to limit women s rights Let s see where you truly stand Today House Democrats offer the Women s Health Protection Act to make abortion access a Federal right no matter your ZIP Code or your income Do my colleagues across the aisle believe that families in consultation with their doctors with their faith with their life circumstances should decide when to have children or do my colleagues think that is a decision for Republican politicians Vote to make Roe v Wade the law of the land Vote for freedom
55	Mr Speaker I rise today to support the Republican rules package and our return to common sense in the people s House I want to point out a few line items in the rules package for particular praise This bill returns to the historical norm of in person meetings and in person votes No more proxy voting or remote committee hearings Let s do the work in the people s House This bill returns to the Holman rule If ever there was a time for this House to stop paying the salaries of bad bureaucrats it is now Tony Fauci deserves that step I think knowing this rules package was coming is one of the reasons why he has now mercifully left government service The power to fire unelectable bureaucrats who abuse their power is a central reason to support this package In the past the 3 day rule has been abused bills being dropped in the dead of night to be voted on 2 mornings later is just wrong Moving to a true 72 hour rule will end that abusive practice Eliminating the Gephardt rule to ensure that this House has a true debate over whether or not to raise the debt limit is a move in the right direction for fiscal sanity in the people s House and so is the three fifths majority requirement to raise taxes I thank my fellow Freedom Caucus members and my friends in House leadership for making these necessary changes to the House rules package and I ask my colleagues to pass this package Now since Ranking Member McGovern mentioned the IRS bill coming up let me just point out that we need to rescind that Mr Speaker do you know what 87 000 IRS agents equates to It equates to 200 new IRS agents in every congressional district in this country That is 1 740 new IRS agents in every State for one purpose to go after small businesses and hardworking Americans to try to raise money to pay for reckless spending reckless spending that has cost 31 trillion in debt in this Nation This is the right thing to do I tell you what Mr Speaker we could repurpose those agents to the southern border or we could repurpose them and let them build the Keystone XL pipeline There were an estimated 61 000 lost jobs with the Keystone XL pipeline when the Biden administration canceled that project But yet we turn around and the government hires 87 000 new IRS agents to go after your constituents and mine Mr Speaker I mentioned earlier the number Look it up
56	Mr Speaker I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for yielding Mr Speaker I rise today in opposition to the rules package which was written behind closed doors What we are voting on this evening is nothing short of a complete surrender to the demands of the most extreme Republicans on the other side of the aisle Rather than taking this opportunity to bring us together the adoption of this rules package sets us on a path of division and default The extremists plan to use these rules to hold the economy hostage in order to enact more cuts to Social Security and Medicare Mr Speaker last week our Nation saw the lowest unemployment in 50 years a testament to the leadership of President Biden and House Democrats Yet it is clear that the new majority is determined to undermine that economic recovery at every turn Mr Speaker I urge a no vote
57	Mr Speaker I rise in strong support of House Resolution 5 adopting the rules for the 118th Congress First this rules package is an incredible win not just for conservatives but for all Americans Americans deserve a House of Representatives that serves the people not a political or a personal agenda For decades we have heard a series of questions things like Why can t we simply pass bills that address a single issue Why do we have to Christmas tree these bills Why isn t there enough time to read the bills Heck why don t Members have to show up to work to get paid I hear that all the time That among other things is what we have addressed in this rules package To be sure folks back home understand this rules package is the document that dictates how we as Members conduct business up here and that is why it is so important to get this right This is the most conservative and transparent rules package in recent history and the thanks go to the Republican Conference at large for working on this and approving this and debating these proposals on three separate occasions since November Here is a sampling of just what is in this commonsense package First every single Member of this body will have at least 72 hours to review each bill Second Members will now be forced to vote in person rather than via proxy Personally I have never voted proxy and for me it is pretty simple If you collect a paycheck you should show up After nearly 3 years of abusing this historic voting change we are finally putting an end to proxy voting If my husband as a first responder along with thousands of other first responders across this country showed up every single shift at the height of COVID without complaint then Members of Congress should be able to do the same Now on November 29 I testified before the Rules Committee that single issue bills are one of the single most important things we can do to restore trust in this institution I am proud to report that this package includes this new requirement and that is for all Members to certify that bills introduced in the House address a single issue A huge thanks goes to my friend and colleague from Virginia Representative Morgan Griffith for his work on this issue Additionally this rules package establishes a brand new select committee that will be tasked to investigate the weaponization of the Federal Government No longer will the Department of Justice be allowed to target parents who show up for their kids No longer will the FBI be able to collude with social media companies to censor Americans Finally in the ultimate move to drain the swamp and one that I am particularly proud of this rules package reinstates the Holman rule which allows Members of this body to offer amendments to appropriations bills to reduce the salary or to fire certain employees or cut Federal programs These unelected bureaucrats the true real swamp creatures here in Washington D C have run roughshod over the American people without consequence and today marks our first but certainly not our last move to hold them accountable Mr Speaker this package is a product that brings transparency and trust to a broken process I thank all of my colleagues from the Republican Conference for their grit and grace in working to put this package together and I urge its passage
58	Mr Speaker the gentlewoman mentioned the 72 hour rule Once again I will say You are welcome Then she talked about this being the most open and transparent rule ever Maybe the gentlewoman can share with us the secret 3 page addendum that we are reading about because none of us have seen it So much for transparency I guess she is not going to share that with us Mr Speaker I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia Ms Norton
59	Mr Speaker these rules are a gratuitous attack on already limited rights of D C residents Our residents have all the obligations of citizenship including paying all Federal taxes but are denied voting rights in Congress and full local self government To add insult to injury these rules take away floor privileges of the D C Mayor The rules continue to grant Governors and 16 other categories of people including foreign ministers floor privileges Not only does D C s Mayor operate like State Governors including managing a jurisdiction that has both a budget and population larger than those of several States but Congress has undemocratic plenary authority over D C and regularly uses this authority to legislate on local matters While D C deserves statehood if any non member of Congress deserves and needs floor privileges it is D C s Mayor
60	Mr Speaker I thank my friend from Oklahoma Mr Cole for yielding I am delighted to be down here on the floor of the House of Representatives in a Republican majority and I am delighted to be talking about a rules package crafted by that Republican majority and that reflects what I think is a fundamental transformation of this House to ensure that the people can be represented by their Representatives That is the point There is a reason that I have had great conversations with some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle about why having 72 hours to read a bill or why having a bill that isn t littered with Christmas tree additional subjects rather than single subjects as my friend from Virginia Mr Griffith articulated so well or whether having germane amendments and being able to open up the floor by virtue of changing the rules or restoring the Holman rule so we can have an impact on agencies that are out of control and not responding to the people s House there is a reason why those rules are so fundamentally important to restore this body and to restore the people s House That is why we are here Everybody keeps running around in classic swamp speak talking about secret deals a secret addendum What we are talking about is how people come to an agreement in this town to ensure that we are going to carry out what we have said we are going to do The rules package is on full display The rules package has been on full display and publicly available since Friday or earlier last week The text of that rules package has been something we can look at My friends are right A good chunk of that text is the agreement reached a while back a couple of weeks ago 1 week or 2 weeks ago with one significant change the single person motion to vacate which is in the spirit of that which goes all the way back to Jefferson In fact we are currently now operating not under any rules That is why we are having a debate We are about to debate on adopting the rules I can walk down right there into the well and file a motion to vacate a single person right now because that is the precedent That is what we are operating under because that goes back to Jefferson The whole point here is trying to ensure that we are continuing the great history of the people s House Yes we have had conversations and agreements as individuals are supposed to do looking each other in the eye and saying that we are going to bring balanced budgets to the floor of the House You bet that we have agreements that we are going to do that You bet we have had agreements that we are going to bring the Texas border plan to make sure that we secure the border rather than perpetuating the fraud that the President of the United States continues to perpetuate endangering the American people You bet that we are bringing forward a promise to have legislation that will set term limits because the American people are tired of a House that doesn t represent them You bet that we have got agreements to do those things You bet that we have been talking about making sure that we can bring amendments to the floor of this House open debate amendments on appropriations bills that that was a part of the package that we were talking about and you bet that a part of our agreement was ensuring that a Church style committee under the leadership of my good friend the gentleman from Ohio Mr Jordan of the Judiciary Committee will target weaponization of government against the American people You bet that those agreements were reached I will not back away from that or shy away from it But this rules package is a rules package that reflects this body and the entirety of the Republican Party on making sure that we restore the people s House We are united to do that We are coming out of last week strong and united to make sure that we stand up for the American people Mr Speaker I encourage everybody to vote for this rules package
61	Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr Speaker I thank the gentleman again for mentioning the 72 hour rule which has been mentioned many times But I wrote it and I thank the gentleman for keeping it But when I hear people talking about balanced budgets give me a break The first bill that my friends are bringing to the floor according to CBO adds 114 billion to the debt We don t need any lectures from anybody on that side about balancing the budget Give me a break Maybe the gentleman can again share with us the secret addendum that apparently was negotiated behind closed doors so we actually know what agreements were made Four days and 15 votes and there is only one change in the rules package going from five to be able to vacate the Chair to one Well there is a lot more to it We all know that but that is a big secret So much for transparency Mr Speaker I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York Mr Torres
62	Mr Speaker the so called rules package proposed by House Republicans would perpetuate same disorder division and dysfunction that nearly devoured the Republican nominee for Speaker A single Member threshold for filing a motion to vacate empowers extremism and rewards rabble rousing It would make the House so dysfunctional as to be ungovernable It would give the new Speaker only a Pyrrhic victory because a motion to vacate makes him arbitrarily removable at any moment at the whim of any person no matter how personal or petty the underlying grievance Simply put this is no way to govern Moreover House Republicans decry the weaponization of the Federal Government Yet the Holman rule would enable the Federal Government to be weaponized against any Federal official who draws the wrath of the Republican majority The Holman rule would enable House Republicans to zero out funding for a criminal investigation into Donald Trump The new rules would defund the Office of Congressional Ethics The new rules would enable a Member being investigated by the FBI to investigate the investigators investigating him Mr Speaker so much for draining the swamp
63	Mr Speaker I thank the gentleman for yielding Last week I was part of the 20 conservative Members who fought for a significant institutional change in order to restore the people s voice in the people s House Of the many victories we secured for the American people the Thomas Jefferson motion to vacate the Chair is the most important to me as it holds the Speaker accountable to the people This Jeffersonian motion stood strong for more than 200 years before then Speaker Pelosi removed it in 2018 consolidating power in the hands of a select few in leadership By restoring this historic rule every solitary Member has the authority to hold the Speaker accountable for following all of the rules including passing single subject bills allowing Members at least 72 hours to read the legislation before voting on it and reinstating the Holman rule which allows amendments to decrease funding for certain government programs all the way down to the individual job description Mr Speaker I thank my Republican colleagues and Speaker McCarthy for working in good faith to produce and pass a rules package that ensures this body is working for the people and not for itself I encourage every Member to vote for it Fixing a broken Washington D C is a major win for every citizen
64	Mr Speaker I rise in strong opposition to this legislation the so called rules package I can t wait for that term limits vote When you ask Members on the Republican side who have been here for 20 or 30 years to then codify their votes that say that you can only be here for 12 try explaining that one back home when you have a four seat majority This is an extreme proposal that is in front of us If they follow the logic to its manifestation this will pit Social Security Medicare and Medicaid against defense spending Our seniors will be sold out our military will be sold out and the full faith and credit of the United States will be under threat all in a quest to organize the House The gentleman from South Dakota a nice enough fellow said people are making a lot about the chaos that ensued here over 4 days particularly last Saturday morning Was the gentleman denying that he was here for the country to witness what happened here This is part of a rules package that is being foisted upon the American people by a small minority within the Republican Party and we ought to turn it down
65	Mr Speaker it is a new day in Congress Mr McGovern you mentioned the 72 hour rule was put in by you and the Democrats Why didn t you enforce it You didn t We were forced to vote on bills like the omnibus that was 4 155 pages long The American people are tired of it Last week was a great week You saw democracy at its best Guess what We were off 24 weeks during the last session We can take however many days it is to debate something that the American people should see The great part about this rules package is it restores financial sanity That is why I am proud to support along with Speaker McCarthy this new rules package that implements fiscal and budgetary restraints on Congress Provisions included are huge wins for the American people for everybody to see We were given the assurance that this package will do the job and we could not continue the downward trajectory that your party has put the American people on over the last 2 years and last 4 years Now is the time that we deal with what is the growing insanity I am just thankful that we are here
66	Mr Speaker this Republican rules package is more like rules wreckage and it has very little to do with governance Adding insult to the American people Speaker McCarthy and MAGA Republicans want to defund the IRS so that their millionaire and billionaire friends don t have to pay their fair share in taxes while hardworking people in Nevada s Fourth District pick up the tab There is a persistent problem with the wealthiest Americans evading taxes or hiding their money in secret offshore bank accounts in order to avoid paying their tax obligations In fact according to a new Syracuse University analysis low income wage earners were audited 5 5 times more than the people in every other tax bracket in 2022 Democrats put people over politics and provided the resources and funding that the IRS needs to go after the super rich tax cheats It is not fair that taxpayers with lower incomes are more likely to be audited than high income taxpayers Adding additional insult their first bill adds more than 100 billion to the deficit over the next 10 years What does that say about reducing our deficit Mr Speaker I urge the body to vote down this hypocritical package
67	Mr Speaker when we conclude this rules debate I will offer a motion to commit to add the expanded child tax credit In the face of the Republican majority s draconian agenda we want to provide a tax cut yes to children and families to make ends meet The child tax credit is the most effective tool we have in the fight against rising costs an antidote to inflation It is about financial stability for families Nothing in this rules package helps American families Make no mistake a vote against a motion to commit means Republicans are willing to raise taxes on working families The expanded child tax credit was the largest tax cut for working families in generations a lifeline to the middle class It drove the largest decrease in child poverty in history People could pay their electric bills fill their gas tanks pay for childcare It reached more than 61 million children lifted 4 million out of poverty and led to a 26 percent decline in hunger in families with children There has never been a Federal program that has had such a profound impact in such a short amount of time Do the right thing Vote yes on the motion to commit
68	Mr Speaker later this evening my colleague and friend Congresswoman DeLauro will offer a motion to add the expanded child tax credit to the rules package This gives us an opportunity to start the 118th Congress on the right foot Instead of focusing on an extremist agenda we can advance a proven solution to an issue that impacts every community in our country childhood poverty The United States shamefully has one of the highest rates of childhood poverty in the developed world We have a solution that we know works the expanded child tax credit that delivered up to 300 per child each month to over 40 million families These resources helped parents pay for food rent gas and other essentials We must bring back the expanded child tax credit and deliver for children and families Mr Speaker I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this motion to commit Reducing childhood poverty should be a bipartisan effort
69	Mr Speaker again let me just ask will anybody on the other side share with us the secret 3 page addendum that Speaker McCarthy negotiated with the Freedom Caucus so we can know what else was decided on given away I guess not Mr Speaker I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California Ms Barragan
70	Mr Speaker I rise in opposition to the rule The rules package is anti Latino It makes in order bills that attack abortion rights and reproductive health that Latinas rely on It doubles down on Republicans inhumane treatment of Latino migrants fleeing violence and persecution Later today Republicans plan to rush a vote on a bill that protects wealthy and ultrawealthy tax cheats leaving low income Black and Latino communities to bear the brunt of tax audits because they make easy targets Republicans have begun this Congress with chaos and now plan to push extreme policies that do nothing to help Latinos in this country Mr Speaker I urge my colleagues to vote against this rule
71	Mr Speaker I thank my friend from Oklahoma for yielding Certainly my colleague from Massachusetts knows my deep affection for him but since I walked on the House floor tonight I keep hearing this reference to this rules package that somehow it is not posted on our website and that we are debating something else called an addendum to the rules package I wanted to come to the House floor as someone who worked quite passionately last week on behalf of our new Speaker working on an agreement with all of my colleagues so that we are unified in the House Republican Conference to say that there is no addendum to this package Mr Speaker There is no 3 page addendum There is no extra stuff Everything in the House rules package is posted on the House website We made one addition as a Conference and that was the change in the vacate the chair motion Mr Speaker I want to be clear in the Congressional Record for those watching on C SPAN and to my colleagues There is not a 3 page addendum to the rules package I greatly respect my good friend from Massachusetts and my friend from Oklahoma
72	Mr Speaker I have great respect for my friend but really I mean come on What were the last 4 days about I mean again days and days and 15 roll call votes and reporting by multiple sources tell us that there is this signed agreement with the House Freedom Caucus that deals with some of the most controversial concessions So you know I know it exists It will come out sooner or later Everybody is talking about transparency and openness It would be nice if there was a little bit more transparency and openness from the other side Mr Speaker I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas Ms Jackson Lee
73	Mr Speaker I rise in opposition to the rules and the rules package In particular I support the Women s Health Protection Act so women seeking reproductive rights will not be hunted down by bounty hunters As well I am opposed to this rule because of the creation of a potential committee that in fact threatens our safety security and freedom It is an unprecedented attack on our Nation s law enforcement agencies our justice system and our intelligence community all for the extreme MAGA Republican political activities This does nothing to solve the actual problems facing the American people and even includes a possibility of defunding police Finally I am glad that the last Congress indicated that when a million Americans died for continuity of government we had proxy voting They wanted to save lives Mr Speaker I oppose the underlying rules and the rules package I ask my colleagues to join me in voting no Mr Speaker I rise in strong opposition to H Res 5 Adopting the Rules of the 118th Congress Instead of building on the extraordinary work done by House Democrats in the 117th Congress Republicans are choosing to lead off this term with legislation that attacks women s health freedoms make it easier for companies to pollute without consequence and hand out tax breaks to the wealthy and well connected This problematic Rules package is the product of non transparent negotiations backroom deals and promises that were made to appease the demands made by extremist members of the Republican Party to get them to vote or in some cases vote present for Speaker of the House Last week s catastrophic Speaker s election showed Americans how disorganized chaotic and inefficient the Republican leadership and Caucus can be Last week s chaos showed the American people how Republicans plan to govern for the next two years This body will be ill managed less transparent slow moving and will put forth legislation that will attack our freedoms and undermine our Nation s values Concessions made by Republican leadership last week will have devastating effects on this institution The passage of this Rules package will pave the way for Any member to file a motion to vacate the chair effectively holding the Speaker hostage Extreme right wing members on key committees Putting an end to the possibility of Congressional staff unionization Reinstating the Holman Rules so Republicans can target civil servants who challenge them and Shut down criminal investigations into the previous president This problematic rule is creating more turmoil in the Republican ranks as members wrestle with the image of witnessing the Speaker being coerced into agreeing to give a small faction of the Republican Conference treats to appease them including concessions to individual members for votes he needed to become Speaker It is not inconceivable that Republican members of the conference must show they are not being bullied into voting for this Rules bill The most problematic aspect of the rule is that it does not spell out what the Speaker agreed to give to his opponents so that the Congress and the American people know what the Speakership actually cost them This is the People s House not the Republican or Democratic House any bargaining should be focused on the needs of the American people they must come first Throughout the last election cycle Republicans campaigned on addressing inflation and lowering the cost of living for millions of Americans Ironically the first bill they are introducing repays the wealthy donors that got them their majority through dark money contributions by making it easier for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans to cheat on their taxes We all may have varying beliefs about taxes but we as Americans know that nothing in this life is free and that in order for our Nation to be a beacon of freedom we must have a strong defense public assistance programs to help those in need an education system that prepares young minds to lead retirement programs that provided for our elder and disabled and a healthcare system that cares for all in need of healthcare Passage of the rule will pave the way for Republicans to continue their assault on a woman s bodily autonomy and impede on medical decisions that should remain between medical professionals and their patient Although the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act does not criminalize abortion nationwide make no mistake that is their end goal and the passage of this bill will get them one step closer to their sick idea of stripping all women of their rights There are concerns that language in the House Rules package would eliminate rules requiring spending offsets for bills that sell or transfer federal public lands and waters This will result in a loss of public access enjoyed by the 70 million American hunters and anglers that help support the 862 billion outdoor recreation economy in the United States Additionally giving away public assets with no return would be a loss for American taxpayers As a result hunters and anglers are strongly opposed to this rule change which would eliminate the necessity of spending offsets to sell or transfer public lands I urge all my colleagues to oppose this bill and see it for what it truly is An effort by Republicans to give tax breaks to the ultra rich and the corporations who fund their campaigns and An effort to continue carrying out their distorted notion of America by decimating the programs set in place to help the Americans who depend on government assistance the most
74	Mr Speaker let me continue what I was beginning in the last exchange At least one GOP office apparently has the much fabled 3 page House rules addendum We are taking a look at it we re just going through it Rep Ken Calvert a Steering Committee member tells Axios Asked if Members have received a copy I don t know if everybody has Again don t come to the floor and talk about transparency and openness and a new day This is backroom politics That is what this is about secret deals that no one is going to know anything about until it is too late Mr Speaker I reserve the balance of my time
75	Mr Speaker I lament that the 2 minutes are no longer magic Mr Speaker these rules are largely the rules that we have had for some period of time over the years but they have important changes Unfortunately I view those changes as not facilitating our work but seeking to impede our work I think that is unfortunate They are also designed to target Federal employees if Members of Congress don t like what they do There of course is a process to do that but as the leader on the other side did at one point in time he just cut out the salary for an employee he didn t like or thought was acting improperly That was not appropriate and of course that did not prevail I regret that we don t have an opportunity to look at these rules in the way that so many on this floor talked about doing First of all of course they are not single issues There are a lot of issues It is the rules Secondly there are ways and means to provide for consideration in a transparent open fashion in which I could offer an amendment to a rule that I thought was not in the benefit of this House or the American people Unfortunately this is the process which is the very first process under which we have considered a piece of business not necessarily legislation and that is ironic It is what it is but it will as such a process does force us to vote against a piece of organizational rules because we don t agree with some of those rules That is what I will do
76	Mr Speaker I am prepared to close as well and I yield myself the balance of my time Mr Speaker the last time House Republicans were in charge they ended their time in power with a government shutdown They controlled the House the Senate and the White House and they shut the government down and walked away Upon taking power once again they began with a legislative shutdown a shutdown where a far right fringe held the incoming Republican leadership hostage and got them to give away everything including their own dignity What is clear from all of this is that the Republican Party no longer cares about governing This rules package is exhibit number one The American people sent us here because they want us to put people over politics Sadly this rules package puts politics first empowering the extremists who are only interested in their own power As I have said again and again if this new majority wants to work together in good faith my door is open If this is their plan they have clearly chosen to become a party that embraces election deniers and extremists and Democrats will not go along to get along Finally Mr Speaker let me say that I have had some harsh words for this rules package Call it tough love I care very deeply about this institution about the work we do here and the awesome responsibility of the decisions we make I am glad that my friends kept the McGovern rule on the 72 hour and the McGovern rule that committees have to do hearings and markups before they come to the Rules Committee We weren t perfect but overwhelmingly we kept our word This legislation does a great disservice to the people we represent and it does not live up to the high standards that we should have for this institution I believe that calling this House to a higher standard is the right thing to do But let me be clear that my criticism is reserved for the resolution we are considering and not for the distinguished gentleman from Oklahoma Mr Cole whom I respect and admire as a person even when we strongly disagree as we do today These rules are a giveaway to the far right but this Congress need not be If my Republican colleagues want to get anything done it is clear that they are going to have to work together with Democrats to get things done Let s end the extremism and put people over politics to get stuff done People do not want government shutdowns People do not want to see us default on our financial obligations People want us to get stuff done and to keep the lights on The last two elections were a rejection of extremism My friends predicted an overwhelmingly Republican majority in the last election and instead they got a pink splash because the American people Democrats Independents and a lot of Republicans said You are too extreme So put the extremism behind you I urge the Speaker to work with Democrats and not just work with the small fringe group in the Republican Conference but to work in a way to move the people s agenda forward I urge a no vote on this resolution a no on the previous question and I yield back the balance of my time
77	Mr Speaker I yield myself the balance of my time In closing I urge all my colleagues to support this resolution establishing the rules of the 118th Congress The changes we are proposing today will ensure that the institution is set on a path of success for the new Congress They will ensure that Members return to Washington and do their work here They will set up an institution to hold the Biden administration accountable They will put in place budgetary rules designed to prevent the kind of reckless spending spree Democrats recently engaged in I urge all Members to vote yes on the previous question and yes on the rule
78	Mr Speaker I rise in strong opposition to H Res 5 Adopting the Rules of the 118th Congress Instead of building on the extraordinary work done by House Democrats in the 117th Congress Republicans are choosing to lead off this term with legislation that attacks women s health freedoms make it easier for companies to pollute without consequence and hand out tax breaks to the wealthy and well connected This problematic Rules package is the product of non transparent negotiations backroom deals and promises that were made to appease the demands made by extremist members of the Republican Party to get them to vote or in some cases vote present for Speaker of the House Last week s catastrophic Speaker s election showed Americans how disorganized chaotic and inefficient the Republican leadership and Caucus can be Last week s chaos showed the American people how Republicans plan to govern for the next two years This body will be ill managed less transparent slow moving and will put forth legislation that will attack our freedoms and undermine our Nation s values Concessions made by Republican leadership last week will have devastating effects on this institution The passage of this Rules package will pave the way for Any member to file a motion to vacate the chair effectively holding the Speaker hostage Extreme right wing members on key committees Putting an end to the possibility of Congressional staff unionization Reinstating the Holman Rules so Republicans can target civil servants who challenge them and Shut down criminal investigations into the previous president This problematic Rule is creating more turmoil in the Republican ranks as members wrestle with the image of witnessing the Speaker being coerced into agreeing to give a small faction of the Republican Caucus treats to appease them including concessions to individual members for votes he needed to become Speaker It is not inconceivable that Republican members of the delegation must show they are not being bullied into voting for this Rules Bill The most problematic aspect of the Rule is that it does not spell out what the Speaker agreed to give to his opponents so that the Congress and the American people know what the Speakership actually cost them This is the People s House not the Republican or Democratic House any bargaining should be focused on the needs of the American people they must come first Throughout the last election cycle Republicans campaigned on addressing inflation and lowering the cost of living for millions of Americans Ironically the first bill they are introducing repays the wealthy donors that got them their majority through dark money contributions by making it easier for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans to cheat on their taxes We all may have varying beliefs about taxes but we as Americans know that nothing in this life is free and that in order for our Nation to be a beacon of freedom we must have a strong defense public assistance programs to help those in need an education system that prepares young minds to lead retirement programs that provided for our elder and disabled and a healthcare system that cares for all in need of healthcare Passage of the rule will pave the way for Republicans to continue their assault on a woman s bodily autonomy and impede on medical decisions that should remain between medical professionals and their patient Although the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act does not criminalize abortion nationwide make no mistake that is their end goal and the passage of this bill will get them one step closer to their sick idea of stripping all women of their rights There are concerns that language in the House Rules Package would eliminate rules requiring spending offsets for bills that sell or transfer federal public lands and waters This will result in a loss of public access enjoyed by the 70 million American hunters and anglers that help support the 862 billion outdoor recreation economy in the United States Additionally giving away public assets with no return would be a loss for American taxpayers As a result hunters and anglers are strongly opposed to this rule change which would eliminate the necessity of spending offsets to sell or transfer public lands I urge all my colleagues to oppose this bill and see it for what it truly is an effort by Republicans to give tax breaks to the ultra rich and the corporations who fund their campaigns and an effort to continue carrying out their distorted notion of America by decimating the programs set in place to help the Americans who depend on government assistance the most The text of the material previously referred to by Mr McGovern is as follows At the end of the resolution add the following new section

83	Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr Speaker the process for considering our first bill of the 118th Congress reflects our commitment to Americans and an open legislative process Congresswoman Michelle Steel and I first introduced this bill in September Members were given more than 72 hours notice prior to today s consideration Mr Speaker 72 hours is more than enough time for Members to review this bill In fact it is two pages long and covers only one topic If Members wish to vote on this bill they must be present in the House Chamber because proxy voting is no longer an option Now let s focus on what this bill does it repeals the vast majority of the Internal Revenue Service funding Democrats enacted last year in order to pay for their Green New Deal The primary purpose of that funding is hiring more auditors and support staff to vastly expand IRS s audit capacity And not just audits on wealthy Americans With that expanded capacity IRS can bring in more revenue by auditing more middle and lower income families and more small businesses Families and small businesses are struggling under the weight of record inflation and supply chain shortages Small businesses are struggling to find workers at any wage The overwhelming majority of Americans about 85 percent follow the law and pay their taxes The last thing they need is more IRS agents knocking on doors to conduct audits Yet this IRS funding is part of the broad Biden administration strategy to tax and audit exponentially more Americans by looking into their bank accounts requiring online payment services to report them when they split a dinner check with friends or pay their babysitter after a night out and then target them using 87 000 new IRS employees Americans deserve to know their government is working for them not against them Today Mr Speaker you are going to hear Democrats claim there really won t be 87 000 new IRS employees I imagine that they will say that new employees aren t going to target middle class families and small businesses and that Republicans don t care about IRS s customer service failings Let s focus on the facts When a Federal agency hires a new employee to replace one who retires it does not increase the agency s head count Yet the Biden administration s own documents say they are increasing the head count by 87 000 over the next decade with these funds Secretary Yellen s own instructions to IRS stated audit rates of families earning less than 400 000 should continue to be audited at historically similar rates Under those instructions 9 out of every 10 new audits can target families earning less than 400 000 And because Republicans are committed to delivering a government that is accountable this bill retains funding for customer service and IT modernization at IRS despite the fact these accounts would be more appropriately addressed through regular appropriations to ensure IRS has the resources to make much needed improvement to taxpayer services Mr Speaker there are numerous reasons to support this bill It protects families and small businesses It ensures agencies are funded appropriately Most importantly it stops autopilot funding for an out of control agency that is perhaps most in need of reform IRS needs to fix its customer service and return processing problems not focus on auditing families and small businesses Americans want an IRS that works for them not against them This bill is a great first step in that direction and I reserve the balance of my time
84	Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr Speaker I rise in strong opposition to H R 23 My friend from Nebraska suggested a number of issues that we intend to challenge during the course of the next half hour based upon the facts This is theater tonight Mr Speaker If we didn t get enough of the entertainment factor last week we are going to proceed with it again this evening Mr Speaker 87 000 IRS agents let me debunk that right away There are regular retirements of up to 8 000 a year we are replacing them How about the methodology of a computer upgrade an investment in technology more modeling or should we have an IRS that operates the way Southwest Airlines did last week to the dismay of the American family This is a messaging bill Mr Speaker The message that they choose to send and let everybody understand this the first bill that they have submitted according to the Congressional Budget Office adds 114 billion to the Federal deficit Legislation number one They don t want a fairer tax administration They think it is bad for some of their supporters You know what they re attempting to do tonight is bad for middle class families it is bad for small businesses who are then asked to pay more when the people at the top don t pay their fair share Mr Speaker I include in the Record a letter from Charles Rossotti the former IRS Commissioner March 1 2020 Hon Richard Neal Chairman Committee on Ways Means House of Representatives Washington DC Dear Chairman Neal I was IRS commissioner from 1997 to 2002 At the time Congress passed a major bill that produced some important long lasting reforms including converting the IRS to electronic filing and improving treatment of taxpayers I believe there is a major modernization opportunity today that could efficiently recover a large amount of revenue It could gradually shrink the tax gap while also easing burden for millions of taxpayers who interact with the IRS I am enclosing my article in Tax Notes entitled Recover 1 6 Trillion Modernize Tax Compliance and Assistance which explains this opportunity I would be happy to talk further to you or your staff about this opportunity Sincerely Charles O Rossotti Commissioner of Internal Revenue 1997 2002
85	Mr Speaker he points out in the opening paragraph of a tax notes special By the way those of us in the tax world know what tax notes means He said that last year this would be 2021 the Federal Government failed to collect 574 billion of taxes that were legally due but not paid That is equal to more than most of the Federal deficit If they want to reduce the Federal tax deficit we should do a better job with tax compliance which after all is the basis of a representative democracy Mr Speaker 86 percent of the American people pay their taxes every year on time Do you know why Because they get paid in wages and it comes from withholding taxes that is what it is about The American people are wise to what is being presented here tonight We live in a two tier tax system Wage earners follow the rules Wealthy billionaires they get to skirt their responsibilities That is what we are being asked to vote on tonight IRS funding has been stagnant staffing levels have dropped Have you tried getting an IRS office on the phone How many times will we continue to let those at the top get away without paying their share We lose out on just think of it again almost 600 billion a year in unpaid taxes It is very sophisticated tax planning that is done by high priced attorneys and CPAs It is estimated that this could be up to 7 trillion because we score items over the course of 10 years What might this funding pay for How about Social Security How about Medicare How about a strong military How about a child tax credit that could be expanded How about universal paid family and medical leave How about bringing down healthcare costs The audit rates amongst millionaires have declined by 70 percent since 2010 Let me repeat that for anybody who didn t get that The audit rate for millionaires has declined by 70 percent since 2010 Low income workers who receive the earned income tax credit they are audited more now than taxpayers who are making over 1 million a year All we are asking for is fairness in the distribution of the responsibilities as to how we pay for government There is a different set of standards across the land now And to point that out to you once again what is our commitment to America It should be based on a fair tax system that collects what is due from those who ought to be paying The former IRS Commissioner a Republican Charles Rettig he pointed out that he was fully in support of the legislation that we were offering because the IRS is continually out maneuvered and out gunned by sophisticated efforts from tax lawyers and CPAs We have to put American families over the politics in the distribution of theater that we are witnessing tonight See through this legislation and vote no Mr Speaker I reserve the balance of my time
86	Mr Speaker I include in the Record an excerpt from a 2021 Biden administration proposal called The American Families Plan Tax Compliance Agenda that asks for 80 billion in IRS funding and clearly shows a plan for 86 852 new hires From the U S Department of the Treasury May 2021 The American Families Plan Tax Compliance Agenda Restoring IRS Resources The first step in the President s efforts to restore IRS enforcement capability is a sustained multi year commitment to rebuilding the IRS This involves spending nearly 80 billion on IRS priorities over the course of the decade including hiring new specialized enforcement staff modernizing antiquated information technology and investing in meaningful taxpayer service including the implementation of the newly expanded credits aimed at providing support to American families Importantly the additional resources will go toward enforcement against those with the highest incomes and audit rates will not rise relative to recent years for those earning less than 400 000 in actual income The President s proposal includes two components a dedicated stream of mandatory funds 72 5 billion over a decade and a program integrity allocation 6 7 billion over a decade These mechanisms provide for a sustained multi year commitment to revitalizing the IRS that will give the agency the certainty it needs to rebuild The IRS proposal includes year by year estimates of the additional resources that will be directed toward the agency as well as the specific activities that these resources would support The design ensures that the IRS is able to absorb and usefully deploy additional resources over the entire 10 year horizon and keeps budget growth manageable at around 10 percent per year
87	Mr Speaker I rise today in support of the Family and Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act one of the first legislative acts of the new Republican majority Main Street America has suffered 2 years too many of Democrats one party rule Inflation continues to hover at record highs and small businesses continue to struggle The last thing that these small businesses can afford right now is 87 000 new IRS agents not only targeting their enterprises but targeting their livelihoods With 11 million tax returns still awaiting IRS action the IRS should be focusing on doing their job rather than weaponizing their agency This isn t new The Democrats have used the IRS and the Tax Code as a weapon before and are attempting to do it again The Family and Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act rescinds new IRS funding intended to target middle class families This cannot wait Mr Speaker I urge passage of this bill so our small businesses can thrive absent any fear of IRS agents knocking at their door
88	Mr Speaker this first Republican bill should be known as the protect Donald Trump and his tax cheating cronies act After years of obstructing access to Donald Trump s tax returns we learned how little he paid toward the cost of our national security and how poorly the Trump Internal Revenue Service enforced our tax laws Each year the richest 1 percent in our country avoid paying an incredible 160 billion of the taxes they owe This crime wave of Trump style tax cheating is made possible by Republican insistence on defunding the revenue police Over the past decade audit rates for corporations are down by half and the ultrarich by three fourths Republican claimed interest in law and order seems to vanish when it comes to tax fraud by the wealthiest few And their very first bill adds 114 billion to our deficit Yes Trump may have been indispensable last week but this is outrageous When those like Trump don t pay what they owe then the tax burden gets shifted to small businesses and to families across the country Reject the Republican drive to defund
89	Mr Speaker I include in the Record a Republican Ways and Means Committee release that explains the Congressional Budget Office s determination that it expects over 20 billion in revenue to come from the increased audits on taxpayers that means families and small businesses making less than 400 000 From waysandmeans house gov August 12 2022 CBO New IRS Audits Will Grab at Least 20B from Lower Middle Income Families Key Point At least 20 billion of the revenue Democrats hope to collect from taxpayers with a supercharged IRS would come from lower and middle income earners and small businesses according to a new analysis by the nonpartisan congressional scorekeeper That s in addition to existing audits of these income levels Explanation Last weekend all 50 Senate Democrats voted against an amendment offered by Senate Finance Republican Leader Mike Crapo R ID that would have protected lower and middle income American taxpayers against new audits by the
90	Mr Speaker I rise today in full support of H R 23 which rescinds the additional funding for the already inflated IRS I think we can all agree that the last thing Americans need right now is a government who is actively working against them One of the most outrageous provisions in the Democrats so called Inflation Reduction Act was giving the IRS 72 billion taxpayer dollars to hire 87 000 additional agents whose job would be to stalk transactions of everyday Americans and attack small businesses Middle class Americans and the small businesses that fuel our economy have been unable to catch a break over the last 2 years That ends today There is simply no reasonable rationale to make the IRS larger than the Pentagon State Department FBI and Border Control together If we are adding an additional 87 000 agents why don t we send them to the southern border to help our border agents who are already overwhelmed and understaffed I stand with my colleagues today in support of H R 23 to block the intrusive and unnecessary 87 000 new IRS agents Americans deserve a government that will work for them and stopping this funding is a first step in the right direction
91	Mr Speaker I include in the Record the Statement of the Administration Policy opposing H R 23 Statement of Administration Policy H R 23 To rescind certain balances made available to the Internal Revenue Service The Administration strongly opposes H R 23 to rescind certain balances made available to the Internal Revenue Service IRS The bill would rescind funding passed in the Inflation Reduction Act IRA that enables the IRS to crack down on large corporations and high income people who cheat on their taxes and evade the taxes that they owe under the law This reckless bill would increase the deficit by nearly 115 billion over 10 years per an estimate by the Congressional Budget Office by enabling wealthy tax cheats to engage in additional tax fraud and avoidance To be clear the Treasury Secretary has already directed that none of the additional IRS resources be used to increase audit rates relative to historical levels for small businesses or households with incomes below 400 000 Far from protecting middle class families or small businesses H R 23 protects wealthy tax cheats at the expense of honest middle class taxpayers Each year the top one percent hides about 20 percent of their income from the government so they can get away with not paying any tax on it That means that working people who report 99 percent of their income to the IRS pay a larger share of collected taxes than they should Not only does it shift the tax burden from the wealthy to the middle class it would also make it harder for middle class families and small businesses to get timely tax refunds and other important services from the IRS by rescinding billions in funding for IRS information technology and operations With their first economic legislation of the new Congress House Republicans are making clear that their top economic priority is to allow the rich and multi billion dollar corporations to skip out on their taxes while making life harder for ordinary middle class families that pay the taxes they owe That s their agenda not lowering costs or cutting taxes for hard working Americans as President Biden has consistently advocated If the President were presented with H R 23 or any other bill that enables the wealthiest Americans and largest corporations to cheat on their taxes while honest and hard working Americans are left to pay the tab he would veto it
92	Mr Speaker I include in the Record an op ed piece from the former IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig a Republican titled IRS sets the record straight We re going after tax evaders not honest Americans From Yahoo Finance Aug 25 2022 IRS Sets the Record Straight We re Going After Tax Evaders Not Honest Americans Op Ed By Charles P Rettig As the nation s tax administrator the IRS plays a unique role in our nation It can be a difficult job After all does anyone really like paying taxes Of course not But they re essential to fund the roads we drive on the schools our children attend support our military and so much more Unfortunately given the nature of this work and historical stereotypes the IRS is often perceived as an easy target for mischaracterizations of what IRS employees do and that s exactly what s happened in recent weeks The recent debate over providing badly needed funding to the IRS is filled with outright false suggestions about what the agency and our hardworking employees do as well as how the additional resources will be handled The bottom line is this These resources are absolutely not about increasing audit scrutiny on small business or middle income Americans The investment of these important resources is designed to support honest compliant taxpayers Our investment is designed around a Treasury directive that audit rates do not rise relative to recent years for households making under 400 000 We all want a fair and impartial system where everyone contributes their fair share no more and certainly no less A robust visible tax enforcement effort focused on high end tax evaders and those supporting them is a priority Underpayments by tax evaders shift the burden of operating our great country onto honest hard working Americans who follow the law With this new law honest taxpayers will see badly needed meaningful service improvements at the IRS The IRS should be able to answer the phones and process information including tax returns in a timely manner Enhanced IT systems and taxpayer services will mean that honest taxpayers will be better able to comply with the tax laws ultimately resulting in a lower yes lower likelihood of being audited and a reduced burden on them To set the record straight on this important legislation and dispel any lingering misperceptions here are some key facts to keep in mind False Statement The IRS is hiring 87 000 armed special agents to harass taxpayers Reality Absolutely false The majority of new hires the IRS makes will be those who answer the phones work on processing individual tax returns or go after high end taxpayers or corporations who are avoiding their taxes Less than 1 percent of new hires will be in our IRS Criminal Investigation IRS CI area which currently has a total of about 2 100 special agents and is currently hiring about 300 more These CI special agents investigate criminal tax violations typically related to money laundering Bank Secrecy National Security and National Defense matters They have been involved in dismantling terrorist financing efforts and criminal cartels as well as eliminating child exploitation operations in the Dark Net that led to the arrests of hundreds of people throughout the world They do not perform civil tax administrative functions such as audits of tax returns They are law enforcement officers and every American should be extremely proud they are on our team False Statement All IRS employees and those being hired under the new legislation will carry firearms Reality Again absolutely false More than 97 percent of IRS employees do not carry weapons This includes key civil side enforcement personnel including revenue agents examiners and others involved in audits and compliance work Less than 3 percent of IRS employees expressly limited to Criminal Investigation special agents carry firearms IRS Criminal Investigation oversees the entirety of the work related to criminal violations of the tax law and other financial crimes This is consistent with other federal law enforcement agencies False Statement The additional funding will be used to hire more auditors to shake down average taxpayers Reality False Wage earning taxpayers like firefighters construction workers teachers and police officers are among the most compliant taxpayers given that their incomes come from Forms W 2 and 1099 These resources are absolutely not about increasing audit scrutiny on small businesses or middle income Americans Instead the additional resources will also be focused on large corporate and high net worth taxpayers to enforce laws already on the books that the IRS does not have enough resources to pursue False Statement The new legislation will be a massive overnight expansion of the IRS Reality False This funding which will be spread over 10 years will add employees over time as we modernize our operations with meaningful technological enhancements In addition the IRS has one of the oldest workforces in government and staffing has been in a deep decline for many years More than 50 000 employees will retire in the next few years leaving the foundation of the tax system that the nation relies on at risk We ve been losing 10 000 employees a year Overall current IRS staffing is far below historical norms In 1992 the IRS had 117 000 employees 38 000 more than today Back then the agency was dealing with fewer taxpayers the U S population has grown almost 30 percent since 1992 False Statement This new funding will allow overreach by the IRS putting agents on every street corner and prying into people s personal financial lives Reality False This funding will allow the IRS to better serve the nation s taxpayers and ultimately meet the critical needs of our country Our employees care and like others in government take an oath to support our country We take pride in hiring veterans people with disabilities and people from all walks of life and from every corner of our country Many of our employees including myself are members of a military family And all of our employees reflect the taxpayers we serve I am an extremely proud American a member of a proud military family and simply will not accept baseless harmful assertions against the interests of our country and the proud hard working employees of the IRS Everyone should know this about IRS employees We care a lot about this country and you
93	Mr Speaker I rise in opposition to this misguided expensive and unpaid for legislation For years my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have done everything they can to demonize the IRS But here is the reality When the IRS doesn t have the funding it needs then two very bad things happen The very wealthy tax cheats are able to avoid paying their fair share and two our constituents who need help from the IRS face unnecessary and destructive delays in getting that help The majority can t criticize the IRS for its performance while simultaneously fighting to cut the IRS budget Despite what my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would lead you to believe Mr Speaker there aren t 87 000 storm troopers funded in this bill who are going to bang down your door That is pure and utter nonsense Taxes are the price we pay to live in a civilized society They are a fundamental part of our civic responsibility to one another This bill is a bad idea and I encourage all my colleagues to vote no
94	Mr Speaker I am pleased today to rise in support of commonsense legislation that puts the American people ahead of padding the coffers of the IRS It wasn t long ago that Washington was under one party rule This Chamber was recently under the leadership of the Democratic Party that worked to give D C bureaucrats more power and wanted to hire an army of IRS agents to harass and audit my constituents while ignoring the need for more border agents to address the crisis at our southern border Congressman Smith s legislation eliminates the devastating IRS provision that Democrats snuck into their so called Inflation Reduction Act by rescinding the funding to this D C agency The facts are that middle and lower income people are audited more by IRS agents by design of the IRS The Kansans I represent need relief from high gas prices and rampant inflation caused by the current administration and one party rule My constituents don t need a supercharged IRS that will investigate their transactions between friends and sic 87 000 new agents on them This bill as the first bill that the new Congress addresses puts our priorities on full display Republicans are ready to restore our Nation and hold government accountable Mr Speaker I urge my colleagues to support this crucial legislation
95	Mr Speaker I thank the gentleman from Kansas my friend He just pointed out that the people at the bottom are audited more than the people at the top That is precisely the point that we are attempting to make here during the course of the next few minutes Mr Speaker I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Maryland Mr Hoyer who is the former majority leader
96	Mr Speaker I thank the gentleman for yielding and adopt all the remarks he made in his opening statement This debate about IRS lends itself to being the most dishonest and demagogic rhetoric that I have seen in the Congress at any point in time I rise as the former chairman of the Treasury Postal Committee now the Financial Services and General Government Committee to which I will return having left the majority leader s spot This bill is a bad bill Every small American taxpayer ought to be for this bill because this bill will make sure that others pay their fair share as they do That is the issue They are paying their fair share as the chairman noted because we take it out of their salary But the people who get it through dividends and capital gains et cetera et cetera aha they have got the lawyers the accountants and the people who can tell them how not to pay their fair share This is a bill against small business This is a bill against the small taxpayer This is against paying your fair share
97	Mr Speaker I include in the Record a Republican Ways and Means Committee release explaining that Senate Democrats voted down an amendment that would prevent increased audits on taxpayers making less than 400 000 a year and House Democrats refuse to take up a bill that would do the same From waysandmeans house gov Aug 17 2022 Democrats Fail To Protect Middle Class From IRS Audits Democrats voted against guardrails that would have protected lower and middle income taxpayers from more audits as a result of supercharging the IRS with 87 000 new agents Instead they hope you ll just take their word for it that the IRS won t target American families who are living paycheck to paycheck Various news outlets have circulated these claims as facts but the bill text says otherwise Reason Magazine s Matt Welch reports Democrats claim they won t target lower and middle income earners with their expansion of the IRS by 87 000 agents top Democrats have been busy escalating their already implausible claims that goosing the IRS enforcement budget by 69 percent over a decade hiring 87 000 additional new staffers at an agency that currently employs 79 000 and nabbing an estimated extra 124 billion in tax revenue will miraculously not bring any percentage increase in audits performed on Americans earning less than 400 000 a year but the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicts boosted IRS funding will increase audits for all taxpayers CBO Director Phillip L Swagel estimated that boosting IRS funding by 80 billion would increase tax revenues by 200 billion the number would later rise to 207 billion before settling at 204 billion adding that the proposal would return audit rates to the levels of about 10 years ago the rate would rise for all taxpayers italics mine though higher income taxpayers would face the largest increase and Democrats voted against Republican amendments preventing lower income earners from being targeted by higher audits In the final IRA bill in fact 45 7 billion is earmarked for enforcement and 25 3 billion goes to operations support There is no reason to conclude from those dollar amounts that the number of resulting audits will be less than originally projected Many fact checkers have refused to verify claims by Democrats As Liz Wolfe has reported repeatedly in the pages of Reason none of these assurances live in the text of the Inflation Reduction Act IRA itself One Republican amendment to prevent the use of additional Internal Revenue Service Funds from being used for audits of taxpayers with taxable incomes below 400 000 was voted down on party lines You ll just have to take Democrats word for it That s good enough for many news organizations who have been coughing up fact checks aimed not at the demonstrable veracity of White House promises about significant legislation impacting literally all adult Americans but at the hyperbole of Republican criticism thereof Democrats will raise audits on the middle class under the guise of going after the tax gap The fact remains that you can t close the tax gap without greater enforcement on the poor and that enforcement on the poor is considerably less expensive It is true that Yellen has freshly directed the IRS to not increase the audit rate of under 400 000s And it s also true that there s no structural enforcement mechanism preventing the agency from continuing to go after low hanging fruit to meet revenue targets Only 3 2 billion of the 80 billion total goes towards improving services for taxpayers just 3 2 billion of the 80 billion is earmarked for customer service producing a mere 9 percent increase over the previous baseline If the agency is bad at answering phone calls and it s bad at answering phone calls a 9 percent bump seems inadequate to the task
98	Mr Speaker I thank the gentleman from Nebraska for yielding House Republicans made a promise to the American people to fight for working class families And we made a promise that our first order of business under a new Republican majority would be to repeal the 80 billion Democrats gave the IRS to hire 87 000 new agents to target American working class families We are delivering on that promise today This bill rescinds the IRS funds in the Inflation Reduction Act a law that does nothing to combat inflation but everything to empower an agency that has targeted Americans They have leaked taxpayer information and under the Biden administration they threatened to snoop into the bank accounts of millions of middle class families We know this because President Biden wrote such a proposal into his first budget as part of his agenda to expand the power of the IRS and shovel billions more to this troubled agency At that time we asked the Joint Committee on Taxation how many Americans might be subject to such a scheme to spy into their bank accounts The JCT said that up to 134 million taxpayers could be targeted So much for just going after the millionaires and the billionaires that our Democrat colleagues like to talk about While the Biden administration including Treasury Secretary Yellen has tried to dismiss concerns over how middle class Americans would be targeted by the IRS under the Democrats 80 billion infusion of cash the Congressional Budget Office has affirmed undoubtedly families making less than 400 000 per year would be subjected to increased enforcement and yes audits by the IRS But of course this would be the case when you realize that more than half of the 80 billion Democrats gave the IRS is earmarked for enforcement The IRS does not need a raise It needs a reckoning And what starts today with rescinding this 80 billion continues through rigorous IRS oversight that Democrats ignored under their one party rule Taxpayers deserve true oversight for an agency that leaked the tax returns of thousands of American taxpayers at the same time the White House was calling for tax increases on those individuals We are talking about an agency with a history of targeting conservatives with woefully underperforming customer service and whose own commissioner under Obama called this 80 billion more than three times the amount of money the agency actually needed House Republicans are ready to provide oversight and accountability and that starts today with ending this 80 billion pay raise
99	Mr Speaker let me congratulate Mr Smith incidentally on his recent elevation to become the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee We look forward to a productive session during the next couple of years Mr Speaker I include into the Record a blog post by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities summarizing the fact check that has repeatedly debunked the false claim that we just heard a few seconds ago that the IRS is going to hire 87 000 new agents immediately From Center on Budget and Policy Priorities January 9 2023 House GOP s First Bill A Misleading Gambit To Protect Interests of Wealthy Tax Cheats By Chuck Marr House Republicans have announced that their first legislative priority is to rescind nearly all of the Inflation Reduction Act s 80 billion in ten year funding for the IRS while repeating falsehoods and inflammatory rhetoric about how that funding will be used While the Republicans have launched a campaign about a false army of 87 000 agents the debate should focus on one accurate and alarming number the IRS has 2 284 fewer skilled auditors to handle the sophisticated returns of wealthy taxpayers than it did in 1954 The decade long House Republican driven budget cuts have created dysfunction at the IRS where relatively few millionaires are now audited If House Republicans succeed in rolling back this critically needed funding and maintaining this dysfunction the IRS would be woefully understaffed hindering its ability to administer the tax code and collect legally owed taxes particularly from high income and high wealth taxpayers On behalf of honest taxpayers policymakers should reject the House Republican effort to protect wealthy tax cheats The IRS workforce is composed of civilian public servants such as accountants and customer service representatives who collect nearly all the federal revenue to fund our government from Medicare and Social Security to our armed forces Its skilled auditors also known as revenue agents are highly trained to handle sophisticated tax returns of wealthy people and multinational corporations All of these IRS employees perform a core function of government are central to the workings of our democracy and work on behalf of honest taxpayers Republican IRS critics however have constructed a narrative around the IRS workforce becoming an army of 87 000 armed agents whose enemies are hardworking American families and small businesses This rhetoric is false and dangerous Fact checkers have repeatedly debunked the 87 000 figure which comes from a prior Treasury estimate that it would use new funding to hire 87 000 total staff over the next ten years including IRS employees in all departments not just skilled auditors These are people who answer phones process returns program computers as well as a fraction albeit an important one who audit complex tax returns The House GOP campaign ignores the reality of today s IRS which has resulted from the sharp budget cuts that Republicans have pushed since 2010 as well as the harm that would flow from rescinding much of the Inflation Reduction Act s new IRS funding The upcoming debate needs to cut through the obfuscation of the House Republican campaign and focus on honest and pertinent numbers Consider in 2021 the IRS had 8 321 skilled auditors That s 40 percent fewer than the agency had in 2010 the year before House Republicans were in the majority and began driving the last decade of steep IRS budget cuts Moreover it s 2 284 fewer revenue agents than the IRS had in 1954 not a typo The last time the IRS had fewer revenue agents than it has today was in 1953 Today s economy is seven times larger than it was in 1953 and our population has more than doubled since then Today s tax returns of wealthy people and large multinationals are more complex and global which take more time for auditors to review As a result of these budget cuts and fewer skilled auditors audit rates have plummeted for wealthy individuals and large corporations For the largest corporations those with more than 1 billion in assets the audit rate fell by more than half between 2010 and 2017 For millionaires the audit rate fell by roughly 77 percent over the same period Preliminary audit data for 2018 and 2019 suggest that the audit rate may have declined over 90 percent between 2010 and 2019 House Republicans want to scare people with their false claims about how the IRS would use the new resources But the reality is that today the IRS skilled audit staff is 2 284 smaller than in 1954 only a tiny fraction of millionaires is audited and large multinationals can hire large squads of lawyers to easily overwhelm the resources of the IRS One only needs to skim President Trump s tax returns the indictment of convicted tax cheat Paul Manafort and a ProPublica investigation of how Facebook outgunned the IRS to grasp the resources necessary to be serious about enforcing our tax laws and how reckless it would be to keep the number of skilled auditors at 1950s levels as the House Republicans would do Honest taxpayers and business owners deserve better They deserve an IRS that processes their tax returns and tax refunds efficiently answers the phone when they call with questions and ensures that the wealthy and profitable corporations are paying the taxes they legally owe A key element of a healthy functioning democracy is a transparent tax system that is fairly enforced so that people and corporations pay what they owe and the well heeled and powerful cannot flout their responsibility to pay their taxes Efforts to protect wealthy tax cheats and purposely undermine the IRS s ability to enforce tax laws are anti democratic and should be resoundingly rejected

101	Mr Speaker I rise to associate myself with the remarks of the distinguished gentleman from Massachusetts I think he used the right words when he talked about theater Isn t it long overdue that we are honest with the American people about what this is about Come on Mr Speaker you can t really believe that what you are proposing here isn t shielding the wealthiest people in this Nation and corporations People at Augie Ray s in East Hartford are not fooled by this and they understand what the agenda is You place us further in debt and leave us with little else to do to help the people who need it the most What is this a guise for Cutting what you call entitlements What people at Augie Ray s know are earned benefits that they pay for every single week out of their paycheck where they pay their taxes as well
102	Mr Speaker I rise today in strong support of the Family and Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act This bill defends American taxpayers against an unchecked supercharged IRS and prioritizes customer service and tax return processing two of the agency s most important functions Included in the Democrats reckless Inflation Reduction Act this past summer the IRS received an additional 80 billion in funding with over half directed toward enforcement What is worse the Democrats bill failed to include any safeguards to protect low and middle income taxpayers from being unfairly targeted for tax audits While the IRS continues to beef up their audit division the agency still has 3 7 million unprocessed tax returns and a total of 11 1 million returns awaiting action This is simply unacceptable The IRS should focus on processing these returns along with addressing the awful level of customer service currently available to taxpayers Law abiding families and small businesses in Illinois need their tax returns processed and phone calls answered not more IRS agents knocking on their doors with burdensome audits Mr Speaker I urge the adoption of this bill
103	Mr Speaker that is precisely the point that we have attempted to make Customer service is not occurring because the IRS has been cut by 30 percent over the last 15 years Mr Speaker I include in the Record a letter from the IRS Commissioner to the House of Representatives confirming that the IRS will not raise audit rates on those making under 400 000 a year Department of the Treasury Internal Revenue Service Washington DC August 4 2022 Dear Member of the House of Representatives It has been the greatest honor of my professional life to spend the last four years at the helm of the IRS I am struck each day by the commitment of dedicated IRS employees to helping American families And our employees have done all that without the tools to do so effectively For too long the agency has not had the resources that it needs to ensure the tax laws are enforced fairly and that Americans receive the level and quality of service they deserve We are the greatest country in the world yet the agency that touches more Americans than any other continually struggles to receive sufficient resources to fulfill its important mission The resources in the reconciliation package will get us back to historical norms in areas of challenge for the agency large corporate and global high net worth taxpayers as well as new areas like pass through entities and multinational taxpayers with international tax issues where we need sophisticated specialized teams in place that are able to unpack complex structures and identify noncompliance These resources are absolutely not about increasing audit scrutiny on small businesses or middle income Americans As we ve been planning our investment of these enforcement resources is designed around the Department of the Treasury s directive that audit rates will not rise relative to recent years for households making under 400 000 Other resources will be invested in employees and IT systems that will allow us to better serve all taxpayers including small businesses and middle income taxpayers Enhanced IT systems and taxpayer service will actually mean that honest taxpayers will be better able to comply with the tax laws resulting in a lower likelihood of being audited and a reduced burden on them Large corporate and high net worth taxpayers often engage teams of sophisticated representatives who pursue unsettled or sometimes questionable interpretations of tax law The integrity and fairness of our tax administrative system relies upon the ability of our agency to maintain a strong visible robust enforcement presence directed to these and other similarly situated taxpayers when they are noncompliant These important efforts also support honest taxpayers who voluntarily comply with their filing and reporting requirements The IRS has fewer front line experienced examiners in the field than at any time since World War II and fewer employees than at any time since the 1970s Advances in technology have been helpful but have not kept pace with the ever increasing responsibilities and challenges facing the IRS As a result the IRS has for too long been unable to pursue meaningful impactful examinations of large corporate and high networth taxpayers to ensure they are paying their fair share This creates a direct revenue loss from evaders and lessens the potential to deter others from pursuing a similar path of noncompliance Every American should support a fair and impartial system of tax administration supported by an appropriately resourced tax administrator In fact the continued success of our country depends in part upon the success of the agency in appropriately fairly and impartially enforcing the tax laws and in providing meaningful impactful services to every American As an extremely proud American I m grateful for your support of the IRS and our dedicated employees I cannot be forceful enough in emphasizing that these resources will be transformative for the agency and for American taxpayers I am available to meet with you at your convenience to discuss the foregoing Thank you Charles P Rettig
104	Mr Speaker I include in the Record a letter from Secretary Yellen to the IRS Commissioner directing the IRS not to use any additional funding to increase audits on small businesses and households earning less than 400 000 a year Department of the Treasury Secretary of the Treasury Washington DC August 10 2022 Charles P Rettig Commissioner Internal Revenue Service Washington DC Dear Commissioner The Inflation Reduction Act includes much needed funding for the IRS to improve taxpayer service modernize outdated technological infrastructure and increase equity in the tax system by enforcing the tax laws against those high earners large corporations and complex partnerships who today do not pay what they owe These crucial investments have been a focus of the Biden Administration since the President s first day in office and I was heartened to see the legislation pass the Senate this weekend Notwithstanding the changes that arose because of Republican challenges during the Byrd process I write today to confirm the commitment that has been a guiding precept of the planning that you and your team are undertaking that audit rates will not rise relative to recent years for households making under 400 000 annually Specifically I direct that any additional resources including any new personnel or auditors that are hired shall not be used to increase the share of small business or households below the 400 000 threshold that are audited relative to historical levels This means that contrary to the misinformation from opponents of this legislation small business or households earning 400 000 per year or less will not see an increase in the chances that they are audited Instead enforcement resources will focus on high end noncompliance There sustained multiyear funding is so critical to the agency s ability to make the investments needed to pursue a robust attack on the tax gap by targeting crucial challenges like large corporations high net worth individuals and complex pass throughs where today the IRS has resources to initiate just 7 500 audits annually out of more than 4 million returns received This is challenging work that requires a team of sophisticated revenue agents in place to spend thousands of hours poring over complicated returns and it is also work that has huge revenue potential indeed an additional hour auditing someone making more than 5 million annually generates an estimated 4 500 of additional taxes collected This is essential work that l know the IRS is eager to undertake For regular taxpayers as you emphasized last week the result of this resource infusion will be a lower likelihood of audit by an agency that has the data and technological infrastructure in place to target enforcement resources where they belong on the high end of the income distribution where the top 1 percent alone is estimated to not be paying 160 billion in owed taxes each year That s important as a matter of revenue raising but it s also essential as a matter of fairness Crucially these resources will support a much needed upgrade of technology that is decades out of date and an in vestment in taxpayer service so that the IRS is finally able to communicate with taxpayers in an efficient timely manner I look forward to working with you on creating new digital tools to allow taxpayers to get information from the IRS instantaneously and on improving taxpayer service so the agency is well equipped to answer calls when they come in This historic investment in our tax system will accomplish two critical objectives It will raise substantial revenue to address the deficit and it will create a fairer system where those at the top who do not today comply with their tax obligations find it far less easy to do so and where all taxpayers receive the service from the IRS that they deserve and that your dedicated workforce is eager to deliver The importance of the work ahead cannot be overstated Sincerely Janet L Yellen
105	Mr Speaker I appreciate how Mr Neal laid out the facts here The Family and Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act is a sham The facts are that this legislation will shield tax cheats at the expense of working families The last time Republicans were in charge they systematically defunded the IRS The agency lost nearly 20 percent of its funding shed more than 20 000 employees and the audit rate for millionaires dropped 70 percent We heard one of our Republican colleagues make that point This legislation will enable those at the top of the heap to be able to remember the taxes they should have reported It raises as we have heard 187 billion in revenue This bill if enacted would add to the deficit 114 billion because it is misguided and misdirected and wrong Mr Speaker I strongly urge the rejection of this legislation enforcement of the laws for everybody
106	Mr Speaker I rise today in support of the Family and Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act This new Republican majority is focused on protecting taxpayers and small businesses from overreach and abuse Blocking the Biden administration from unleashing 87 000 new IRS agents on taxpayers is a crucial first step toward fulfilling our commitment to America This legislation will prohibit the IRS from using new funds to target lower and middle class families and small businesses with more burdensome and intrusive audits As households grapple with a struggling economy the last thing they need is more harassment from a supercharged IRS Republicans are unified in our effort to bring economic relief to Americans not more government overreach and hardship Mr Speaker I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and stop the administration s weaponizing of the IRS
107	Mr Speaker I rise in rigorous opposition to this shortsighted bill but thank you for allowing us the opportunity to lay the facts on the table I mean it is stunning that while you peddled those falsehoods you seek at the same time to add 114 million to the deficit The chairman said it Everybody said it Republican budget cuts have left the IRS with 2 284 fewer skilled auditors to keep wealthy taxpayers from cheating than it had in 1954 That makes no sense You know it is more complicated We taxed work before Now we tax assets and we cover them up when we do our taxes Who the heck are you kidding The GOP plan would aid and abet a flood of tax cheating by Wall Street tycoons That would be the direct impact of this bill Thankfully it is going to be dead on arrival when it goes to the other side of the building Republicans love that our massive tax gap keeps growing and they want to make it worse
108	Mr Speaker on March 1 2022 President Biden made a promise to the American people during the State of the Union Address before a joint session of Congress I was sitting in this room as the President stated Under my plan nobody earning less than 400 000 a year will pay an additional penny in new taxes Nobody Mr Speaker the President lied to us all because in August 2022 CBO confirmed that the Democrats Inflation Reduction Act which supercharges the IRS with 87 000 new agents will in fact lead to more audits and enforcement measures and higher taxes for families making less than 400 000 a year In fact the CBO confirmed that lower and middle income taxpayers would see as many as 710 000 more audits Americans are suffering under harmful inflation caused by the irresponsible fiscal policies from President Biden and our congressional Democrats The last thing the American people need is burdensome IRS audits Mr Speaker I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this bill to make Joe Biden s promise come true
109	Mr Speaker I know this may be the beginning of a new year but we are back to the same old thoughts ideas and practices Protect the wealthy Disadvantage the poor We need a tax system that is fair We need the skilled auditors who can look at the more complex returns of wealthy taxpayers and make sure that they are paying their fair share There is no doubt that this is a sham Vote this down because it takes away opportunity for fairness in our tax system We need the auditors
110	Mr Speaker very briefly I point out that the Biden administration is not giving us all the information Secretary Yellen said that the IRS will not raise audit rates for taxpayers making less than 400 000 relative to historic levels What does historic levels really mean I include in the Record a CBO blog post from 2021 examining the Biden administration s 80 billion proposal and stating that it would return audit rates to the levels of about 10 years ago and that the rate would rise for all taxpayers From the CBO Blog Sept 2 2021 The Effects of Increased Funding for the IRS By Phill Swagel Last month the Congressional Budget Office published An Analysis of Certain Proposals in the President s 2022 Budget Since then CBO has completed its analysis of another proposal in the President s budget an increase in spending for the Internal Revenue Service s IRS s enforcement activities CBO estimates that portions of the Administration s proposal to increase funding for the IRS by 80 billion over the 2022 2031 period would increase revenues by approximately 200 billion over those 10 years That estimate does not include changes in revenues resulting from portions of the proposal that involve new information reporting requirements and other changes to the tax code those changes are estimated by the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation JCT the proposal The Administration proposes funding for the IRS that is 80 billion greater over 10 years than the amounts in CBO s July 2021 baseline projections which reflect the assumption that current laws generally do not change Two types of funding would be provided discretionary appropriations which would mainly be used for enforcement activities and mandatory funding which would be used for a variety of activities not only enforcement but also operations support business systems modernization and taxpayer services Spending would increase in each year between 2021 and 2031 though the highest growth would occur in the first few years By 2031 CBO projects the proposal would make the IRS s budget more than 90 percent larger than it is in CBO s July 2021 baseline projections and would more than double the IRS s staffing Of the 80 billion CBO estimates about 60 billion would be for enforcement and related operations support The Administration also proposes that financial institutions increase their reporting about account inflows and outflows Part of the increased funding would support the implementation of a new information reporting system to be used by those institutions The resulting effects on revenues are estimated by JCT and are not included in CBO s estimate of an approximately 200 billion increase how cbo estimates the effect on revenues of increased irs funding CBO s estimate of revenues is based on the IRS s projected returns on investment ROIs for spending on new enforcement initiatives The IRS estimates those ROIs by calculating the expected revenues that would be raised from taxes interest and penalties as a result of the new initiatives and dividing them by their additional cost The agency has provided ROIs over the past five years as part of its budget justification The IRS s ROIs ramp up over three years as staff become trained and fully productive arrive at the peak level and then stay there In recent years peak ROIs have ranged from 5 to 9 That is a 1 increase in spending on the IRS s enforcement activities results in 5 to 9 of increased revenues CBO adjusts the ROIs so that they better reflect the marginal return on additional spending First CBO expects the IRS to prioritize the enforcement activities that it thinks will have the highest average return additional enforcement spending would therefore have lower returns than previous spending Second CBO expects taxpayers to adapt to the IRS s enforcement activities and adopt new ways of evading detection so an enforcement activity may have a lower return in later years Finally the productivity of the IRS s enforcement activities will also depend on the IRS s other capabilities For example modernized information technology that stored all of a taxpayer s information in digital form could increase the productivity of examiners the employees who detect taxpayers noncompliance CBO s estimate of revenues also accounts for the timing of collections resulting from enforcement activity by new hires Taxes are assessed at the end of an audit if taxpayers disagree with the assessment they can appeal and continue to litigate The length of each step depends on the complexity of the case CBO estimates that an audit of medium complexity would take 24 months to complete That time combined with the expected training time for an experienced new hire suggests that the IRS would begin to collect revenues 30 months after the new hire joined the agency The timing would be longer when cases were more complex or when the taxpayer did not agree to the assessment and appealed what is incorporated into cbo s estimate CBO s estimate of the change in revenues is relative to the amount of revenues collected under current law which is reflected in CBO s baseline budget projections Under guidelines agreed to by the legislative and executive branches this change in revenues typically would not be included in a cost estimate for legislation that brought about the change but it would be reflected in CBO s baseline budget projections once the legislation was enacted CBO s estimate reflects the assumption that the proposed increase in funding would follow the proposed expansion of information reporting Expanded information reporting might allow the IRS to better target potentially noncompliant taxpayers it might also prompt taxpayers to file more accurate tax returns It might have a positive effect on revenues collected but it might also reduce the ROIs from enforcement activities because if returns are more accurate there will be less noncompliance to audit In CBO s and JCT s judgment those effects roughly offset each other on net resulting in a small positive effect on ROIs CBO s estimate includes direct revenues and protected revenues Direct revenues are generated from the IRS s auditing and collection efforts Protected revenues result when the IRS prevents a taxpayer from recouping previously assessed and paid taxes for example when the IRS prevents fraudulent refunds or disallows claims in taxpayers amended returns The estimate reflects CBO s expectation that the increased enforcement activities would change the voluntary compliance rate that is the share of taxes owed that are paid voluntarily and on time only modestly The magnitude of that effect is highly uncertain however and the empirical evidence about the effects of audits on taxpayers behavior is inconclusive Research about such deterrence finds varying responses depending on the type of taxpayer People generally increase their reported income in the years following an audit but people with higher income generally do not and neither do corporations For more discussion see Box 1 in CBO s July 2020 report Trends in the Internal Revenue Service s Funding and Enforcement how the current analysis differs from previous analyses In that July 2020 report CBO estimated that a 40 billion increase in enforcement funding would raise 103 billion for a net effect of 63 billion The methods used for this estimate differ in several ways from the methods used for that one First CBO used updated ROIs that incorporated the IRS s most recent estimates of the return on enforcement activities CBO then adjusted the ROIs to reflect both direct revenues and protected revenues increasing the peak ROI from 6 4 to 7 1 Second CBO s current methods allow for positive interaction between enforcement spending and other IRS funding That is CBO accounts for ways in which increased capabilities such as more digitization of taxpayers information and greater visibility of income flows can increase the productivity of enforcement activities Third this analysis reflects a longer time frame for receiving enforcement revenues because of the complexity of audits associated with high wealth individuals large corporations and partnerships Taxpayers with greater resources may be more likely to appeal assessments or to litigate their disputes in the U S Tax Court delaying the receipt of assessed taxes As a result revenues from some audits will not be received until later than CBO estimated in its July 2020 analysis sources of uncertainty The change in revenues resulting from an increase in the IRS s funding could be different from CBO s estimate It depends on the IRS s ability to hire experienced candidates changes in voluntary compliance and the interaction of enforcement funding with the IRS s other capabilities The IRS intends to hire mid and senior level people with private sector experience who will not require a great deal of training to become productive But it might not be able to hire its desired mix of candidates If it hired less experienced candidates it would have to spend more resources training them Not only would they take longer to become productive but current staff members would have to devote more time to training them A related source of uncertainty in CBO s estimate is attrition If it proved higher than expected personnel would have fewer years at full productivity An increase in the IRS s funding could signal that the agency was more capable of detecting noncompliance thus increasing voluntary compliance and revenues However if there were fewer noncompliant taxpayers to audit the ROIs from the IRS s enforcement activities would drop and the direct revenues from increased enforcement would be lower than CBO estimated Finally it is unclear how much the greater information reporting or the increased IRS spending in areas other than enforcement such as technology could improve examiners productivity Greater nonenforcement spending might increase overall revenues but decrease ROIs for example if improved services for taxpayers enabled those taxpayers to more accurately determine their tax liability reducing the pool of noncompliant taxpayers to audit effects on taxpayers The proposed increase in spending on the IRS s enforcement activities would result in higher audit rates than those underlying CBO s baseline budget projections Between 2010 and 2018 the audit rate for higher income taxpayers fell while the audit rate for lower income taxpayers remained fairly stable In CBO s baseline projections the overall audit rate declines resulting in lower audit rates for both higher income and lower income taxpayers The proposal by contrast would return audit rates to the levels of about 10 years ago the rate would rise for all taxpayers but higher income taxpayers would face the largest increase In addition the Administration s policies would focus additional IRS resources on enforcement activity aimed at high wealth taxpayers large corporations and partnerships CBO estimates that if the proposals were enacted tax compliance would be improved and more households would meet their obligation under the law Higher audit rates would probably also result in some audits of taxpayers who would later be determined not to owe additional taxes However the Administration s proposal for more information reporting as well as additional spending on IRS technology might reduce the burden on compliant taxpayers by allowing the IRS to better target noncompliant ones and to reduce the number of audits that resulted in no change in tax assessment
111	Mr Speaker I rise in support of the Family and Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act The last 2 years under Democrat rule have resulted in terrible policies and more unnecessary taxes for the American people Americans have been feeling the weight of destructive policies since their first day in power and now it is time for our Republican majority to fix this mess The pressure on American taxpayers has continued to increase since the passage of the so called Inflation Reduction Act when they gave 80 billion of new funding for the IRS to hire the 87 000 new agents to needlessly audit families and small businesses that are forced to fund the out of control spending and misguided Green New Deal priorities How do more audits and scrutiny from the IRS benefit hardworking Americans Liberals in Congress chose to target American taxpayers by supercharging the IRS which solely focuses on auditing the hardworking Americans who already pay more than their fair share This is unacceptable and must be reversed Through the Inflation Reduction Act Democrats used the tools of the IRS as a means to increase reckless spending
112	Mr Speaker Charles Rettig the former IRS Commissioner who was appointed by the Trump administration said early last year that the United States is losing 1 trillion in unpaid taxes every year He said the agency lacks the resources to catch tax cheats Most of the unpaid taxes he said are a result of evasion by wealthy and large corporations With this legislation we are considering today it is clear that the GOP once again is putting tax evading profits over people Mr Speaker I am asking my colleagues to join me in rejecting this legislation to protect working families that play by the rules and fight fairly every day
113	Mr Speaker I rise in strong support of the Family and Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act and I am proud to co lead this important legislation with the gentleman from Nebraska Mr Smith my friend As millions of American families across the country struggle to afford basic goods from food to fuel in large part thanks to the inflation brought on by the absurd spending blowout of the last 2 years the very last thing that taxpayers need is a bloated and weaponized IRS Unfortunately that is exactly what they got when the administration rammed through 80 billion to hire 87 000 new IRS agents to harass and spy on middle class and low income families with most of 1 2 million new additional audits The agency needs reform and modernization but that is not what these billions in taxpayer dollars did Of the 80 billion only 3 2 billion was set aside for taxpayer services Meanwhile new audits and enforcement got 45 billion The job of the IRS is to serve taxpayers not target them That is why we must pass today s bill which will rescind the IRS funding for enforcement while leaving in place the funding for improvements to customer service and technology Californians and all Americans deserve an accountable government and a strong economy An accountable government is one that serves its citizens not one that empowers bureaucrats to target taxpayers We will never build an economy that is strong by weaponizing government agencies to cripple small businesses and employers Mr Speaker I urge all of my colleagues who support an accountable government and a strong economy to vote yes on this legislation to empower American families support small businesses and protect taxpayers
114	Mr Speaker the challenge that was offered by the gentlewoman from California is as simple as this We are weaponizing billionaires not to pay their fair share That is what is happening What we are asking here is the simplicity of allowing people at the very top to pay their fair share Mr Speaker I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Alabama Ms Sewell a capable and valued member of the Ways and Means Committee
115	Mr Speaker I rise to speak against H R 23 The funding provided through the Inflation Reduction Act is an important step to address the lack of resources for the IRS so that they could do their job How many of us have called the IRS and been on the phone waiting for hours only to be told that you were being transferred to yet another department and also continue to be waiting Over the past year the IRS has already been cut by 15 percent and more cuts means more delays and lack of services for our constituents As Representative Neal said the IRS failed to collect over 500 trillion last year alone because of lack of resources lack of compliance and the targeting of those people who are less fortunate through the EITC compliance They have been hurt Mr Speaker this is about tax compliance This is also about racial equity and fairness Historically African Americans have been disproportionately audited by the IRS due to their claims of EITC I ask for fairness and equity and ask for my colleagues to vote no against this bill
116	Mr Speaker today we begin the work to reform our government to work better for the American people and not against them So what do I mean by that The last 2 years Democrats have had control of the White House House and Senate and they have passed and attempted historic spending provisions In order to do that you have to raise revenue This bill became a ploy to leverage the IRS to be able to essentially do that without directly raising taxes That is what we are talking about here I represent thousands of IRS employees They are some of the best most hardworking people in my entire district As I talk to them they care about two major things customer service and that technology needs to be improved That is what I love about this bill because that keeps that in here and we actually want to focus our spending to be able to directly support them As we put forth this bill we are sincerely trying to take what all of our constituents have been saying We need the IRS to have more support on customer service and technology That is why I urge everybody to vote yes on this bill
117	Mr Speaker I rise in strong opposition to this bill It is telling that the very first bill that the new Republican majority brought to the floor aims to protect wealthy tax cheats from following the law For a decade Republicans succeeded in stripping the IRS of the resources it needs to serve the American people and the result has been frustrating and harmful to workers and families but it is certainly fantastic for wealthy tax cheats who unfairly kept up to 1 trillion from the IRS every year Congressional Democrats reversed this trend when we passed the Inflation Reduction Act Now the IRS will finally have the resources it needs to properly audit wealthy taxpayers and corporations with complex returns and ensure that average Americans don t have to wait hours on the phone to fix problems Americans deserve an IRS that fulfills its most basic duty to ensure all taxpayers and corporations follow the law and pay their fair share in taxes Vote no on this bill
118	Mr Speaker I rise in strong support of the Family and Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act I am a small manufacturing businessowner and I have also worked as a tax attorney so I know firsthand the kind of power that the IRS has over our small businessowners and lower and middle income taxpayers Last year to fund their leftwing agenda the Democrats in Congress decided to spend your hard earned tax dollars on 87 000 new IRS agents making the IRS nearly the size of the U S Marine Corps The Biden administration claims these agents will not set their sights on hardworking Americans The facts reveal the opposite The Democrats claim these new audits will only affect Americans making over 400 000 The facts prove otherwise However the investment of 80 billion with over 40 billion being spent for enforcement will exact just a fraction of the revenue they hope to get to fund their spending sprees The American taxpayers deserve better The truth is their plan will target middle and lower income taxpayers The CBO agrees and it released a finding that said additional agents will lead to as many as 700 000 more audits on Americans making less than 75 000 a year The core principle of our system of government is innocent until proven guilty not guilty until proven innocent as the IRS attempts to do I encourage my colleagues to support H R 23
119	Mr Speaker I rise to strongly oppose this misnamed Republican bill which purports to protect families and small businesses but instead continues the unrelenting effort to starve the IRS The only Americans that this legislation protects are tax cheats What is up with this conversation about how many agents are going to be added The IRS has fewer agents today than it had in 1953 and our economy is seven times larger and our population has more than doubled since then The characterization of the IRS as a militant government agency deployed to harass unwitting small businesses and Americans is a flagrant lie Our voluntary tax system depends on our taxpayers trusting that it works fairly We need to ensure that the IRS can examine complex tax avoidance strategies of well heeled individuals and businesses period To do that we need to help the agency modernize and transition away from decades old technology and we must support the agency s capacity to effectively administer a range of crucial tax benefits I urge my colleagues to vote no
120	Mr Speaker I will clarify what exactly this bill is doing Last year Congress gave an additional 80 billion to the IRS on top of 12 billion of existing funding which increased the IRS budget by almost eight times This bill still keeps almost 10 billion in additional funding to modernize IRS which is still almost doubling their 12 billion budget but eliminates over 70 billion of wasteful and egregious aggression against the American taxpayer by the Federal Government As someone who spent over a decade in public accounting and also started my own businesses I never felt that we didn t have enough government On the contrary I hear the same message when I go all across my district small businesses and entrepreneurs have a hard time surviving I hope my Democrat colleagues will also support this commonsense adjustment to relieve the undue burden on American families
121	Mr Speaker I thank Mr Neal for yielding The Inflation Reduction Act was a huge step toward lowering healthcare costs and energy costs for families all across the country and creating new jobs in my home State of Michigan It was fully paid for by making sure the biggest corporations and the wealthiest individuals paid their fair share in taxes This funding for the Internal Revenue Service helps ensure that it has the resources to go after those wealthy taxpayers that are avoiding paying their fair share It is simply not fair that billionaires like Elon Musk and massive companies like Amazon have paid less in Federal income taxes some years than a Bay City teacher a Saginaw nurse or a Midland factory worker Further the Inflation Reduction Act is helping to fight inflation bringing down costs for Americans With this bill Republicans are trying to roll back these efforts to fight inflation A vote against the motion to recommit that I will offer is a vote against the Inflation Reduction Act Today the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said this bill will add 114 billion to the national deficit This is the first order of business for this majority Mr Speaker I ask unanimous consent to add the text of this amendment in the Record immediately prior to the vote on the motion to recommit
122	Mr Speaker it is a bright new day Today we begin to deliver real results for the American people by passing legislation to block the Biden administration from unleashing 87 000 new bureaucrats and agents at the IRS on families and small businesses Last Congress Democrats voted to supercharge the IRS with 80 billion of taxpayer money focused on IRS enforcement and hiring more auditors to squeeze taxpayers It is not just wealthy Americans With that expanded audit capacity the IRS can squeeze more money out of middle and lower income families and small businesses as well The Democrats American Rescue Plan called for the IRS to require payment apps like Venmo and PayPal to report Americans who made over 600 in transactions Imagine what 87 000 new agents will do Republicans want an IRS that works for taxpayers not targets them That is why this bill leaves in place the IRS funding for improvements to customer service and technology Because Americans demand and deserve a government that is accountable not to the powerful but to the people repealing funding for Biden s army of auditors is a great first step in the right direction
123	Mr Speaker I rise in opposition to this absurd legislation The bill before us will cut the necessary investments to make the IRS more responsive to regular people improve customer service and work through the IRS backlog In exchange for making the IRS less responsive to the people the bill is going to add 114 billion to the deficit according to the CBO Why My Republican friends want us to believe that a horde of 87 000 armed Federal agents are ready to kick in your doors for tax enforcement This is total nonsense a fantasy a fabrication that has been fact checked over and over again and always found false The real reason they are passing this bill is to protect wealthy tax cheats like the former President from having their tax returns scrutinized The richest 1 percent avoid paying 100 billion every year because we don t fund the IRS Republicans first priority is to help the very rich tax evaders at the expense of their own regular American constituents I urge Members to vote against this misguided legislation
124	Mr Speaker I thank my friend from Nebraska for yielding The idea Mr Speaker of hiring 87 000 new IRS agents to close the tax gap is misguided I served as revenue secretary for the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania We did in fact close a tax gap through what proved to be very effective measures These measures included improving IT systems and processes which truly determined tax evasion from tax avoidance Largely taking the easy approach of hiring 87 000 new agents doubling the size of the IRS I don t know who thinks that is a good idea does not improve the quality of information used to accomplish the goal of collecting all tax revenues that are due It will only increase the number of audits most often on innocent small businesses and individuals As well the CBO projection of 186 billion of increased revenue was established before the administration said that only those above 400 000 in income would be audited Currently nearly 90 percent of the audits are conducted on small businesses and those making less than 400 000 How can you make a projection when your targeted audience is reduced by 90 percent This is an absolutely flawed plan that will do nothing but increase the size of government increase audits on law abiding businesses and fail to achieve its intended results It is Big Government at its worse According to the CBO the hiring of these new IRS agents will also cause audit rates to rise on all taxpayers A bipartisan analysis found that this increase in funding would result in 1 2 million more audits 700 000 of them will target taxpayers making 75 000 or less These new IRS agents will not be targeting wealthy tax cheats as they claim They will be targeting everyday Americans
125	Mr Speaker I rise in strong opposition to this legislation that will cut major investments in the IRS that will help American taxpayers receive the benefits they have earned It is important This tax cheat act would gut IRS funding to protect Republicans wealthy corporate investors It is important to understand that I urge my colleagues to reject the Republican tax cheat act It is important because this is politics above people The reality is this is not about people This is really all about politics I thank Mr Neal who led this effort through the Ways and Means Committee and colleagues who fought for the importance of investment in the IRS Mr Speaker I stand today to encourage people to say no
126	Mr Speaker I have a very high opinion of the gentleman from Massachusetts but what scares me in this bill are the numbers Right now the IRS has about 78 000 employees of which about 10 000 are what they describe as agents It is not surprising that is less than you had in 1954 because in 1954 nothing was computerized Now the 1099s the W 2s they come in and automatically the computers show whether they are on your return or not If they are not on the return you get a letter from the IRS saying you owe X amount of money Now we are going in one bill from 78 000 employees adding an additional 83 000 We have no idea how many of those are going to be agents poking around looking at people but you have to figure it is going to be an increase of five or six times what they already have Wisconsin and Massachusetts are States about the same size You are talking about adding 1 600 employees assuming it is the same per capita about 1 600 new employees to Massachusetts and Wisconsin What are they going to do with 1 600 new employees I mean I can t imagine If you deal with the IRS the way they deal with it they do things like Well you owe 20 000 You have to find a lawyer to fight that
127	Mr Speaker I think part of that new recruiting class at the IRS is going to simply answer the phones That would be helpful a step in the right direction Mr Speaker I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois Mr Schneider a CPA who really knows something about compliance
128	Mr Speaker I rise today to urge my colleagues to oppose this bill It not only increases our national deficit by 114 billion but it does so by helping the wealthiest avoid paying taxes and transfers that burden onto the backs of hardworking Americans and small businesses that follow the law and pay their taxes on time Here is my question Why on their very first day legislating with their new majority with their very first bill is the top Republican priority rewarding tax cheats with what is estimated to be nearly 200 billion in uncollected taxes over the next 10 years 200 billion in taxes not paid by the wealthiest meaning additional debt for everyone else The Inflation Reduction Act dedicated 46 billion to enforcement to make sure corporations and wealthy individuals pay the taxes they owe not new taxes not higher rates simply ensuring everyone pays what they owe Mr Speaker I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to oppose this outrageous tax scam
129	Mr Speaker I rise to speak in favor of H R 23 which would defund the 80 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act or as I call it the inflation enhancement act and thereby defund the hiring of 87 000 new IRS agents which would in effect double the agency Nary a one not one of my constituents has asked to hire 87 000 new IRS agents but in fact countless have asked if we can hire 87 000 new Border Patrol agents because there is a crisis and a catastrophe on our southern border The last thing we want is to double an agency that is already bloated and have them with these 87 000 new agents or in military parlance five new divisions to harass stalk and otherwise terrorize law abiding American citizens Who is this going to really kick in the teeth It is not going to be the wealthy or the poor It is going to be the small business owners and the middle class hardworking Americans Do you want to start a new Congress and do it well This is a great bill and I urge the passing of H R 23 the Small Business and Taxpayer Protection Act
130	Mr Speaker a reminder that the 87 000 is over 10 years The 80 billion is over 10 years That is 8 billion a year for replacement of those who retire who leave the service of the IRS Mr Speaker I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California Mr Panetta another very capable member of the Ways and Means Committee
131	Mr Speaker I rise in opposition to H R 23 because our government needs the resources to go after wealthy tax cheats who defraud the government Because people don t pay their taxes the Federal Government is cheated out of at least 400 billion each year In fact President Trump s IRS Commissioner said that number could be as high as 1 trillion every year That significant source of revenue could go to paying our bills paying down our debt and propping up the power of our purse That is exactly why we passed legislation last year that made significant investments to crack down on tax cheats That funding will not be used for families or small businesses making less than 400 000 Instead it will be used to go after those who have the wealth to pay their taxes but don t or those who can pay for armies of accountants to get out of paying for what they should H R 23 rescinds that funding for that type of needed enforcement and that is why I oppose it Our government should have the resources necessary to ensure that it is not just the middle class that pays our bills and pays our debt but the wealthy tax dodgers pay their taxes just like play by the rules hardworking Americans
132	Mr Speaker I include in the record a CBO post from 2021 examining the Biden administration s 80 billion proposal and stating that CBO projects the proposal would make the IRS budget more than 90 percent larger than it is in CBO s July 2021 baseline projections and would more than double the IRS staffing From CBO Blog Sept 2 2021 The Effects of Increased Funding for the IRS By Phil Swagel Last month the Congressional Budget Office published An Analysis of Certain Proposals in the President s 2022 Budget Since then CBO has completed its analysis of another proposal in the President s budget an increase in spending for the Internal Revenue Service s IRS s enforcement activities CBO estimates that portions of the Administration s proposal to increase funding for the IRS by 80 billion over the 2022 2031 period would increase revenues by approximately 200 billion over those 10 years That estimate does not include changes in revenues resulting from portions of the proposal that involve new information reporting requirements and other changes to the tax code those changes are estimated by the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation JCT The Proposal The Administration proposes funding for the IRS that is 80 billion greater over 10 years than the amounts in CBO s July 2021 baseline projections which reflect the assumption that current laws generally do not change Two types of funding would be provided discretionary appropriations which would mainly be used for enforcement activities and mandatory funding which would be used for a variety of activities not only enforcement but also operations support business systems modernization and taxpayer services Spending would increase in each year between 2021 and 2031 though the highest growth would occur in the first few years By 2031 CBO projects the proposal would make the IRS s budget more than 90 percent larger than it is in CBO s July 2021 baseline projections and would more than double the IRS s staffing Of the 80 billion CBO estimates about 60 billion would be for enforcement and related operations support The Administration also proposes that financial institutions increase their reporting about account inflows and outflows Part of the increased funding would support the implementation of a new information reporting system to be used by those institutions The resulting effects on revenues are estimated by JCT and are not included in CBO s estimate of an approximately 200 billion increase How CBO Estimates the Effect on Revenues of Increased IRS Funding CBO s estimate of revenues is based on the IRS s projected returns on investment ROls for spending on new enforcement initiatives The IRS estimates those ROls by calculating the expected revenues that would be raised from taxes interest and penalties as a result of the new initiatives and dividing them by their additional cost The agency has provided ROls over the past five years as part of its budget justification The IRS s ROls ramp up over three years as staff become trained and fully productive arrive at the peak level and then stay there In recent years peak ROls have ranged from 5 to 9 That is a 1 increase in spending on the IRS s enforcement activities results in 5 to 9 of increased revenues CBO adjusts the ROls so that they better reflect the marginal return on additional spending First CBO expects the IRS to prioritize the enforcement activities that it thinks will have the highest average return additional enforcement spending would therefore have lower returns than previous spending Second CBO expects taxpayers to adapt to the IRS s enforcement activities and adopt new ways of evading detection so an enforcement activity may have a lower return in later years Finally the productivity of the IRS s enforcement activities will also depend on the IRS s other capabilities For example modernized information technology that stored all of a taxpayer s information in digital form could increase the productivity of examiners the employees who detect taxpayers noncompliance CBO s estimate of revenues also accounts for the timing of collections resulting from enforcement activity by new hires Taxes are assessed at the end of an audit if taxpayers disagree with the assessment they can appeal and continue to litigate The length of each step depends on the complexity of the case CBO estimates that an audit of medium complexity would take 24 months to complete That time combined with the expected training time for an experienced new hire suggests that the IRS would begin to collect revenues 30 months after the new hire joined the agency The timing would be longer when cases were more complex or when the taxpayer did not agree to the assessment and appealed What Is Incorporated Into CBO s Estimate CBO s estimate of the change in revenues is relative to the amount of revenues collected under current law which is reflected in CBO s baseline budget projections Under guidelines agreed to by the legislative and executive branches this change in revenues typically would not be included in a cost estimate for legislation that brought about the change but it would be reflected in CBO s baseline budget projections once the legislation was enacted CBO s estimate reflects the assumption that the proposed increase in funding would follow the proposed expansion of information reporting Expanded information reporting might allow the IRS to better target potentially noncompliant taxpayers it might also prompt taxpayers to file more accurate tax returns It might have a positive effect on revenues collected but it might also reduce the ROIs from enforcement activities because if returns are more accurate there will be less noncompliance to audit In CBO s and JCT s judgment those effects roughly offset each other on net resulting in a small positive effect on ROIs CBO s estimate includes direct revenues and protected revenues Direct revenues are generated from the IRS s auditing and collection efforts Protected revenues result when the IRS prevents a taxpayer from recouping previously assessed and paid taxes for example when the IRS prevents fraudulent refunds or disallows claims in taxpayers amended returns The estimate reflects CBO s expectation that the increased enforcement activities would change the voluntary compliance rate that is the share of taxes owed that are paid voluntarily and on time only modestly The magnitude of that effect is highly uncertain however and the empirical evidence about the effects of audits on taxpayers behavior is inconclusive Research about such deterrence finds varying responses depending on the type of taxpayer People generally increase their reported income in the years following an audit but people with higher income generally do not and neither do corporations For more discussion see Box 1 in CBO s July 2020 report Trends in the Internal Revenue Service s Funding and Enforcement How the Current Analysis Differs From Previous Analyses In that July 2020 report CBO estimated that a 40 billion increase in enforcement funding would raise 103 billion for a net effect of 63 billion The methods used for this estimate differ in several ways from the methods used for that one First CBO used updated ROIs that incorporated the IRS s most recent estimates of the return on enforcement activities CBO then adjusted the ROIs to reflect both direct revenues and protected revenues increasing the peak ROI from 6 4 to 7 1 Second CBO s current methods allow for positive interaction between enforcement spending and other IRS funding That is CBO accounts for ways in which increased capabilities such as more digitization of taxpayers information and greater visibility of income flows can increase the productivity of enforcement activities Third this analysis reflects a longer time frame for receiving enforcement revenues because of the complexity of audits associated with high wealth individuals large corporations and partnerships Taxpayers with greater resources may be more likely to appeal assessments or to litigate their disputes in the U S Tax Court delaying the receipt of assessed taxes As a result revenues from some audits will not be received until later than CBO estimated in its July 2020 analysis Sources of Uncertainty The change in revenues resulting from an increase in the IRS s funding could be different from CBO s estimate It depends on the IRS s ability to hire experienced candidates changes in voluntary compliance and the interaction of enforcement funding with the IRS s other capabilities The IRS intends to hire mid and senior level people with private sector experience who will not require a great deal of training to become productive But it might not be able to hire its desired mix of candidates If it hired less experienced candidates it would have to spend more resources training them Not only would they take longer to become productive but current staff members would have to devote more time to training them A related source of uncertainty in CBO s estimate is attrition If it proved higher than expected personnel would have fewer years at full productivity An increase in the IRS s funding could signal that the agency was more capable of detecting noncompliance thus increasing voluntary compliance and revenues However if there were fewer noncompliant taxpayers to audit the ROIs from the IRS s enforcement activities would drop and the direct revenues from increased enforcement would be lower than CBO estimated Finally it is unclear how much the greater information reporting or the increased IRS spending in areas other than enforcement such as technology could improve examiners productivity Greater nonenforcement spending might increase overall revenues but decrease ROIs for example if improved services for taxpayers enabled those taxpayers to more accurately determine their tax liability reducing the pool of noncompliant taxpayers to audit Effects on Taxpayers The proposed increase in spending on the IRS s enforcement activities would result in higher audit rates than those underlying CBO s baseline budget projections Between 2010 and 2018 the audit rate for higher income taxpayers fell while the audit rate for lower income taxpayers remained fairly stable In CBO s baseline projections the overall audit rate declines resulting in lower audit rates for both higher income and lower income taxpayers The proposal by contrast would return audit rates to the levels of about 10 years ago the rate would rise for all taxpayers but higher income taxpayers would face the largest increase In addition the Administration s policies would focus additional IRS resources on enforcement activity aimed at high wealth taxpayers large corporations and partnerships CBO estimates that if the proposals were enacted tax compliance would be improved and more households would meet their obligation under the law Higher audit rates would probably also result in some audits of taxpayers who would later be determined not to owe additional taxes However the Administration s proposal for more information reporting as well as additional spending on IRS technology might reduce the burden on compliant taxpayers by allowing the IRS to better target noncom pliant ones and to reduce the number of audits that resulted in no change in tax assessment
133	Mr Speaker at a time when we should be tightening our belts Democrats plan to spend 80 billion on 87 000 IRS agents doubling the size of the department This is meant to nickel and dime audit and harass America s small businesses and families who they know cannot afford the legal fees to fight this army Mr Speaker 87 000 IRS agents but we only have 20 000 Border Patrol agents and an unprecedented crisis with terrorists convicted criminals and illegal immigrants crossing in addition to fentanyl We only have 5 000 drug enforcement agents to stop traffickers who are peddling this poison to our kids the number one killer of young Americans Mr Speaker 87 000 IRS agents is more than twice the size of the FBI and more than the entire staff of the Department of Justice We know that our colleagues on the other side love taxes spending Big Government and bureaucracy but the American people don t That is why we should be voting yes on this legislation today
134	Mr Speaker I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California Mr Gomez not only a very capable member of the committee but last week during those 4 days here of utter chaos he carried that child around this Chamber During those 4 days I think the child grew by 2 inches That is how long we were there
135	Mr Speaker in 2017 Republicans handed out tax breaks for the largest corporations and the ultrawealthy including Donald Trump who paid zero Federal income tax in 2020 and left the Presidency without a single audit What we were trying to do was make it a fairer tax system where the ultrawealthy were actually paying their fair share which as we saw through the simple release of those tax returns for the President of the United States there were some years he paid zero He was less likely to be audited than somebody getting the earned income child tax credit This is something that we need to fight against We want to make sure that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle understand that it is not just about the ultrawealthy It is about working class Americans It is a shame that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle care more about those who have higher income those who can hire lawyers that can get them out of paying taxes but we should really have a tax system that benefits everybody
136	Mr Speaker I am proud to stand here today as a single mother and a small business owner in support of the Family and Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act One of the most outrageous provisions in the Democrats hyperpartisan Inflation Reduction Act was giving the IRS 72 billion to hire an additional 87 000 agents Look the hiring of 87 000 new IRS agents only squeezes American taxpayers including small business owners like myself the backbone of our communities My colleagues on the other side let me tell you this I live and work and now represent a border district that houses a Border Patrol sector They need feet on the ground They have the same number of agents on the ground as compared to 3 years ago Why aren t you fighting that hard for these agents The Biden administration will tell you that they have increased agents but they have only increased agents in the processing and administration which ultimately has led to the mental health deterioration The American people deserve a government that works for them not against them
137	Mr Speaker let me rename this legislation to the billionaire tax cheats happy days are here again because that is simply what this bill is about I know my constituents are in one of the difficult districts in the Nation and I realize that small businesses in my district those who are getting earned income tax credit they want refunds They can t get them if the phones are not being answered and there are not enough staff to help them get the refunds that will help them propel their small business into the next year Then of course Mr Speaker what about the lady who was trying to close a real estate deal and there was no one at the office That created a 68 000 tax burden because the tax office was not available to assist We need to provide those workers to help Americans not to create tax cheats This legislation is deserving of opposition because we as Democrats are trying to make the IRS work for working families get their refunds get their dollars help them propel into the next year and be better for the moneys that they deserve to get back Vote no on the underlying legislation Mr Speaker I rise in strong opposition to H R 23 the Family and Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act This bill would rescind 72 billion of the 79 6 billion appropriated to the Internal Revenue Service to refine its services and technology and reform its enforcement practices of the federal tax code The passage of H R 23 would widen the already massive tax gap and unfairly relieve the wealthiest 1 of Americans from paying their fair share of taxes The historic passage of the Inflation Reeducation Act under the leadership of Speaker Pelosi and signed by President Biden authorized 79 6 billion to allow the Internal Revenue Service to bolster taxpayer services while firmly and fairly enforcing the federal tax code Through the implementation of the IRA we continue to help the millions of Americans who most depend on federal government assistance and who contribute disproportionately to the federal revenues that pay for our government to operate 45 6 billion of the authorized funds included in the Inflation Reduction Act were allocated for tax enforcement activities including hiring more enforcement agents providing legal support and investing in investigating technologies These funds are necessary to bridge the unjust tax gap that Americans have been subject to for generations and will continue to endure under Republican leadership The entirety of the 79 6 billion is critical to cracking down on ultra rich and corporate tax evaders who have avoided paying their fair share of taxes for years The passage of this bill would dismantle key components of the Inflation Reduction Act that have injected fairness into the enforcement of our tax system The IRA reduced rising costs for hardworking middle class and working class families and ensured that taxpayers are not left to foot the bill for ealthy tax cheats both of which would be erased with the passage of this bill These unfair tax practices have gone on for far too long I urge all my colleagues to oppose this bill and see it for what it truly is an effort by Republicans to give tax breaks to the ultra rich and the corporations who fund their campaigns and an effort to continue carrying out their distorted notion of America by decimating the programs set in place to help the Americans who depend on government assistance the most
138	Mr Speaker only in Washington can one defend doubling the size of the IRS and spending 80 billion to hire 87 000 new IRS agents According to my friends across the aisle that is a good thing because the billionaires and the millionaires don t pay their fair share Yet according to the IRS the top 25 percent of income earners pay 89 percent of all income taxes Does anyone really believe that the 87 000 new IRS agents and employees are going to really stop there Of course not How else will the Democrats fund their out of control and reckless spending There aren t enough billionaires and millionaires in the United States to pay for it My friends on the other side will do what they always do They will target hardworking taxpayers families and small businesses that are the lifeblood of our economy It has to stop Coming from a State like New York we need to cut taxes We need to reduce the cost of living and make it more affordable for our hardworking families Mr Speaker I proudly support this legislation and urge all of my colleagues to vote yes and end the 87 000 new IRS agents that are going to terrorize hardworking Americans
139	Mr Speaker for 3 days and 3 long nights every class of Republican came to this floor to argue about which of them hated the national debt more Now as the first thing they bring forth a bill that will increase the national debt by 1 6 trillion according to six bipartisan Secretaries of the Treasury Working people can t evade taxes They get W 2s and 1099s Republicans support this bill because every time a billionaire successfully cheats on his taxes a member of the Freedom Caucus earns his wings As co chair of the bipartisan CPA Caucus and former head of the second largest tax agency in America I say we need staff to put the Service back into the Internal Revenue Service One employee for every 2 000 tax returns filed that is the staffing level that Ronald Reagan insisted upon It is the level Democrats would restore Trump took outrageous positions on his returns and counted on a light audit Whereas Ronald Reagan paid his taxes and staffed the IRS Don t make honest taxpayers feel like suckers Stand with Ronald Reagan and vote No
140	Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr Speaker I rise with concern about some of these points that have been raised I think we have heard it from both sides that the IRS is not answering the phone like they should to actually serve the taxpayers taxpayers who want to do the right thing It is conceivable that there would be taxpayers overpaying as well because of the complexity in the tax code and yet the record shows over the years that there have been innocent taxpayers taxpayers who already paid what they owed who were still audited and were considered guilty until they proved themselves innocent To me that is a huge problem We just heard that there is concern about the debt and yet the answer is just more government employees in fact more than double of what the current number of employees are I have huge concerns about that and that is why I think we need to vote for this bill get the President and the Senate to agree to this and work together to focus on customer service issues that everyone knows are a concern at the IRS I hope that again this use of technology can really lead the way with a goal of customer service rather than just hiring more full time equivalent employees I don t think that will actually result in the efficiencies that some are claiming would supposedly raise the revenue that it would I just think we need to adopt this bill get this passed and come together after that realizing that we can and should expect the IRS to do better Mr Speaker I reserve the balance of my time
141	Mr Speaker as my friend the gentleman from Nebraska pointed out with the Presidential audit system Joe Biden overpaid his taxes I hope the Record will reflect that that the Democratic President overpaid his taxes and the IRS wisely made sure that he had the proper refund Mr Speaker I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Ohio Ms Kaptur the longest serving woman in the history of Congress
142	Mr Speaker I rise in opposition to this Republican green light to tax cheaters billionaires and giant corporations that do not pay their fair share of taxes The average working person in our country pays a rate of about 25 percent Billionaires pay under 5 percent Every citizen and corporation should take a pledge of allegiance to pay their fair share of taxes But Amazon Chevron AIG and even Coca Cola shirk their duty to liberty Jeff Bezos Elon Musk and Charles Koch prosper under liberty s flag but cheat on their taxes In what world is it fair that those in the top brackets can cheat the system while hardworking Americans pay their fair share every day I can assure you staff in our offices have answered over a thousand calls since 2020 because the IRS doesn t have enough agents to do the job Properly funding the IRS will help to reduce the deficit average Americans will get answers and help and tax cheaters will finally pay their fair share Mr Speaker I include in the Record a laundry list of tax cheaters Amazon Exxon Mobil AT T Microsoft Verizon Chevron Bank of America UPS Nike Coca Cola Charter Communications AIG Jeff Bezos Mark Zuckerberg Bill Gates Michael Bloomberg Larry Page Sergey Brin Steve Ballmer Elon Musk Rob Walton Charles Koch
143	Mr Speaker I yield myself the balance of my time for the purpose of closing Mr Speaker this has been an edifying debate But as Harry Truman noted let s just talk about the facts Let s debunk the argument that we are hiring 87 000 armed IRS agents to go knocking on doors in the middle of the night This is a substantial investment in technology This is a substantial investment in customer service Yes the 80 billion is over 10 years That is 8 billion a year to improve customer service That is what we are talking about At least 8 000 agents retire from the IRS every year We are simply replacing them You know in our school systems back home when 200 teachers retire we replace 200 teachers That is what we are doing here with the IRS They make this preposterous argument that all of a sudden next week 87 000 armed because you always have to use the language that is incendiary enough to get people worked up around here that 87 000 armed agents in the dark of night will be hounding innocent taxpayers despite what Janet Yellen said about no taxpayer making under 400 000 a year is going to be targeted Mr Rossotti the former IRS commissioner not me said at least 574 billion a year goes uncollected He is a Democrat A Republican IRS commissioner Mr Rettig who we worked with said it might be a trillion dollars a year that goes uncollected a Donald Trump appointee who stated that and raised that issue a number of times in front of the Committee on Ways and Means Let me make a point that I raised earlier Tax compliance in a representative democracy is a fundamental commitment to civilization and first class services So by not collecting this revenue are we going to say down the road well maybe we will cut Social Security maybe we will cut Medicare maybe we will cut Medicaid or maybe we will cut the American military Now we all know that in this discussion that the facts are very clear here They have been upset with the IRS for a long period of time We all remember the Lois Lerner episode even though the facts in that case pointed out that the advocates on the right and the left were audited at the same rate That is a fact So as we close this argument out let s stand up for the honest taxpayers in America and make sure that the IRS that currently cracks down on the EITC will be able to actually address some of the complexities of modern tax law which we all agree by the way the system is far too complex but I have been through that argument many times here as well This fear mongering that you are hearing tonight about upgrading the technology and software investments at the IRS for the purposes of modeling for better tax compliance is just that It is fear mongering All we want is a set of rules that is applicable to all as it relates to tax collection This is not anything other than simply suggesting that there is a fairness that is applied to the Internal Revenue Service so that they might address and make sure that those at the very top are complying with the same laws we ask the wage earners through withholding to address every single day Thanks for a spirited debate Mr Speaker and to our friends on the other side Mr Speaker I yield back the balance of my time
144	Mr Speaker I yield myself the balance of my time Mr Speaker I appreciate the conversation that we have had here I think there is fundamental disagreement on what the real solutions need to be although I think there is agreement that the current customer service at the IRS is significantly underperforming Now in 2019 in a bipartisan fashion we passed the Taxpayer First Act In fact our highly respected colleague the late Representative John Lewis led the way on that as well This was about customer service and reform at the IRS Were there benefits from that COVID got in the way I think that does actually beg the question of what have been the impacts of COVID on customer service at the IRS Mr Speaker I am concerned that when there are resources afforded the IRS they are just not used the way they can and should be especially as it relates to customer service and the honest taxpayers that my colleague from Massachusetts references We want to do everything we can when the American people are doing the right thing for the right reasons and abiding by the law Yet they would still be exposed to having to prove themselves again after they already did with voluntary tax compliance But here comes an audit I vividly recall the fact that in the 1990s the IRS as an agency overstepped In fact I believe it was President Clinton that even pulled back the IRS somewhat because they were going after law abiding taxpaying Americans who already did everything they were supposed to do That certainly establishes my concern about why we would see legislation passed last year that would pretty randomly put forward funding that I think will ultimately get in the way of these taxpaying Americans who like I said already did everything they were supposed to do but yet they have to incur the expense Mr Speaker I urge the passage of this bill for good public policy and I yield back the balance of my time
145	Mr Speaker I rise in strong opposition to H R 23 which would gut the enforcement of our tax laws As part of the Inflation Reduction Act Democrats fought hard last year to help the IRS crack down on wealthy tax cheats like Donald Trump But House Republicans want to make sure the IRS remains underfunded understaffed and unable to catch the top one percent who hide over 20 percent of their income from the IRS each year Meanwhile the working people who pay their taxes will wait longer for tax refunds and assistance because of these cuts Do not let Republican talking points about IRS funding mislead you This bill will only help tax cheats avoid paying their fair share House Republicans are only protecting their fat cat allies like Donald Trump Instead of catering to their billionaire friends I urge my Republican colleagues to prove they actually care about working people by voting no on this bill
146	Mr Speaker I rise in opposition of H R 23 the Family and Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act Hard working families pay 99 percent of the taxes they owe while the uber wealthy the 1 percent has the ability to hide more than 20 percent of their income from the IRS each year Tonight the first bill I will vote on is designed to help the 1 percent avoid paying their fair share House Republicans are protecting sophisticated tax cheats and greedy corporations and they do so under the guise of cutting the budget of the Internal Revenue Service My office has been working with many families who have experienced financial hardship while waiting months for the IRS to process their tax refunds which are often thousands of dollars Why Because the agency has less auditors than in 1954 and tax returns are processed on computer systems designed more than 40 years ago This is a direct result of years of attacks and budget cuts by Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration Last year Democrats passed the Inflation Reduction Act which includes investments to replace retiring taxpayer service workers and update aging technology to increase efficiencies so hardworking taxpayers can receive prompt refunds and service Republicans should be helping the Americans waiting on hold for hours to get their tax refunds instead of making it easier for tax cheats to skip out on paying their fair share
147	Mr Speaker I rise in strong opposition to H R 23 the Family and Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act This bill would rescind 72 billion of the 79 6 billion appropriated to the Internal Revenue Service to refine its services and technology and reform its enforcement practices of the federal tax code The passage of H R 23 would widen the already massive tax gap and unfairly relieve the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans from paying their fair share of taxes The historic passage of the Inflation Reeducation Act under the leadership of Speaker Pelosi and signed by President Biden authorized 79 6 billion to allow the Internal Revenue Service to bolster taxpayer services while firmly and fairly enforcing the federal tax code Through the implementation of the IRA we continue to help the millions of Americans who most depend on federal government assistance and who contribute disproportionately to the federal revenues that pay for our government to operate Simply put Americans who have the least should not be burdened with the responsibility to contribute the most Every American most importantly the wealthiest among us must pay what they rightfully owe to enable our government to function 45 6 billion of the authorized funds included in the Inflation Reduction Act were allocated for tax enforcement activities including hiring more enforcement agents providing legal support and investing in investigating technologies These funds are necessary to bridge the unjust tax gap that Americans have been subject to for generations and will continue to endure under Republican leadership The entirety of the 79 6 billion is critical to cracking down on ultra rich and corporate tax evaders who have avoided paying their fair share of taxes for years The passage of this bill would dismantle key components of the Inflation Reduction Act that have injected fairness into the enforcement of our tax system The IRA reduced rising costs for hardworking middle class families and ensured that taxpayers are not left to foot the bill for wealthy tax cheats both of which would be erased with the passage of this bill These unfair tax practices have gone on for far too long I urge all my colleagues to oppose this bill and see it for what it truly is an effort by Republicans to give tax breaks to the ultra rich and the corporations who fund their campaigns and an effort to continue carrying out their distorted notion of America by decimating the programs set in place to help the Americans who depend on government assistance the most

152	Mr Speaker I rise today to recognize National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day is an opportunity for citizens to recognize the difficult and sometimes impossible jobs police officers have chosen to do There is no doubt that morale across law enforcement in our country has decreased due to negative public sentiment over the last few years However our selfless public servants have not let that deter them from doing their jobs To have a strong police force the officers must know that their communities support the work that they are doing That is why I am proud to recognize our men and women in uniform I encourage everyone in the First Congressional District to go above and beyond today and every day to show their appreciation to our law enforcement They are the best among us and deserve our unwavering support
153	Mr Speaker it has been 38 years and I rise with enthusiasm on reintroducing H R 40 the Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act I am pleased to reintroduce this legislation and to acknowledge to my friends and colleagues that it was first introduced in 1989 after the implementation of the American Civil Liberties Act that provided compensation to Japanese Americans H R 40 does not focus on all of that only It focuses on the study of slavery and the understanding of what would be the next steps to end the vast disparities in the African American community even today in 2023 And so this introduction allows for a study an analysis and action I am pleased with the more than 350 organizations CEOs scholars State and local officials and Members of Congress who have been supportive in understanding the era of slavery in this country The 13th amendment may have ended slavery but the disparities exist Let us pass H R 40 the Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act Mr Speaker I am pleased to re introduce H R 40 the Commission to Study and Develop Reparations Proposals for African Americans Act This legislation was first introduced by retired Member of Congress John Conyers of Michigan in 1989 and was intended to examine the institution of slavery in the colonies and the United States from 1619 to the present and further recommend appropriate remedies Since the initial introduction of this legislation its proponents have made substantial progress in elevating the discussion of reparations and reparatory justice at the national level and joining the mainstream international debate on the issues Though some have tried to deflect the importance of these conversations by focusing on individual monetary compensation the real issue is whether and how this nation can come to grips with the legacy of slavery that still infects current society Through legislation resolutions news and litigation we are moving closer to making more strides in the movement toward reparations Today there are more people at the table more activists more scholars more CEOs more state and local officials and more Members of Congress However despite this progress and the election of the first American President of African descent the legacy of slavery lingers heavily in this nation While we have focused on the societal effects of slavery and segregation its continuing economic implications remain largely ignored by mainstream analysis These economic issues are the root cause of many critical issues in the African American community today such as education healthcare and criminal justice policy including policing practices The call for reparations represents a commitment to entering a constructive dialogue on the role of slavery and racism in shaping present day conditions in our community and American society Over the last several years we have had a distinguished academic and activist panel from the National African American Reparations Commission dive into some of the most salient points in the discussion of reparations I am supporting this effort by continuing to hold the annual reparations retrospective at the Annual Legislative Conference of the Congressional Black Caucus I believe that H R 40 is a crucial piece of legislation because it goes beyond exploring the economic implications of slavery and segregation It is a holistic bill in the sense that it seeks to establish a commission to also examine the moral and social implications of slavery In short the Commission aims to study the impact of slavery and continuing discrimination against African Americans resulting directly and indirectly from slavery to segregation to the desegregation process and the present day The commission would also make recommendations concerning any form of apology and compensation to begin the long delayed process of atonement for slavery With the over criminalization and policing of black bodies a reoccurring issue in African American communities I believe this conversation is both relevant and crucial to restoring trust in governmental institutions in many communities As in years past I welcome open and constructive discourse on H R 40 and the creation of this commission in the 118th Congress Though the times and circumstance may change the principal problem of slavery continues to weigh heavily on this country A federal commission can help us reach into this dark past and bring us into a brighter future
154	Mr Speaker the men and women from sea to shining sea that wear a badge have sworn an oath to the Constitution That oath is not to a sheriff or a marshal or a chief it is to the people of their community and deeper the principles that have built our country We put on our badges and uniforms and we say good bye to our wives not knowing if we will return For many many years on my way to night shift I would tell my wife I loved her and she would hand me my little lunch She would say Come home safe I would say Don t worry about me worry about the other guy That was our little ritual but the truth was we never knew if I was coming home Right now men and women across the country are having similar conversations and wearing a badge Just know we love you and respect you This body supports you
155	Mr Speaker I rise today to commend basketball superstar LeBron James for calling out sports media bias Late last year a photo resurfaced of Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones blocking the integration of an Arkansas high school in 1957 Mr James asked why he was not getting any questions about this photo and stated that the media had plenty of questions after former teammate Kyrie Irving promoted an anti Semitic film on social media Jerry Jones owns an 8 billion sports franchise the world s most valuable one according to Forbes The Cowboys rank among the worst NFL teams for minority hiring The possible connection between these points is far more important than the hateful beliefs of one basketball player Yet the media asks about Irving and stays quiet about Jones It is a question the media needs to answer for James and the Black community in America
156	Mr Speaker I guess the President of the United States was able to find the southern border on a map It took him 2 years to finally get down to the southern border and what happens Everybody just goes around and cleans up everything that is going on in El Paso Let me tell you something The people of Texas know the truth In Texas we are dealing every single day with 6 000 7 000 or 8 000 people crossing the border every day Now with a House majority we have got the will and we have got the power to do something about it It is time we do something because the people of Texas are taking the brunt every single day There are still migrants that are being sold into the sex trafficking trade There are still Americans who are dying from fentanyl poisonings No camera presence down in El Paso no going down there for a show trip is going change the fact that Texans are struggling It is time right now for the House majority to do our job We are going to have to stop funding a Department of Homeland Security that refuses to secure the border of the United States We are going to do that this year
157	Mr Speaker last month we ended the vaccine mandate for the military but there are still many unscientific illogical and unconstitutional mandates for vaccines in this country If you watched C SPAN last week you saw 434 of us in here screaming yelling cheering speaking many of us unvaccinated Most of us probably not boosted Why do we have a double standard Why do we make visitors of this country get vaccinated just to visit their friends and family Why are we separating families over this We need to end that mandate We need to end the healthcare mandate We need to end all of the mandates and we need to do this now

166	Mr Speaker I rise to pay tribute to Bill Harper my long time Chief of Staff as he retires after 22 years in my office on January 6 2023 It has been a privilege to work the past 22 years with Bill He exemplifies what it means to be a public servant Bill has dedicated his life to making a positive impact for Minnesota families communities and businesses For more than 2 decades he has been responsible for building and leading my congressional team Bill s knowledge vision and leadership have helped shape everything my office has accomplished particularly my work on the House Appropriations Committee Prior to serving in Congress Bill managed my first election to the House of Representatives in 2000 but his commitment to public service began much earlier For 5 years he was an outstanding Peace Corps volunteer in Guatemala and Malawi where he worked with local villagers to improve their lives and livelihoods His work as Chief of Staff to former Hennepin County Board Chair Mark Andrew and as a personal assistant to former Minnesota Attorney General Hubert H Humphrey III prepared him with the necessary skills to successfully manage a congressional office A significant aspect of Bill s public service is his success in nurturing the next generations of leaders and public servants He has assembled a staff that I am exceptionally proud of a dedicated team of public servants who bring nearly 130 years of combined service in their work on behalf of Minnesotans In addition numerous former staff and interns have gone on to further service in the executive branch state government nonprofit organizations and elected office Bill has always put the people we serve first making a remarkable difference in lives across the country and around the world That is the essence of Bill s dedication to others I know that Bill will continue to make important contributions to Minnesota and our nation well into the future On New Year s Day the Star Tribune published a profile on Bill Harper s distinguished service in my office In the article he noted as powerful as Washington and Congress may be we are a direct extension of the people And it needs to stay that way His words ring true and it is my pleasure to enter that article into the Record As he prepares for the next chapter of his career I wish him and his family Roberta Jonas Lucia and Tiwonge all the best It has been an honor to have Bill serve as my Chief of Staff and I m grateful that he ll remain as a friend and political advisor Mr Speaker please join me in paying tribute to his remarkable career of service to our nation and our community From the Star Tribune Dec 31 2022 After More Than Two Decades Chief of Staff Set To Leave Rep Betty McCollum s Office Bill Harper has been a congressional chief of staff during a crucial span in U S history His long tenure working for Democratic U S Rep Betty McCollum began after the controversial 2000 presidential election and continued on past the Sept 11 attacks the Iraq War the Great Recession the outbreak of COVID 19 and the U S Capitol insurrection As he prepares to leave the job in January Harper is aware that he was part of a transformative historical period But he said in a recent interview about his more than two decades on the job that it all comes back to serving the people and trying to make our democracy and trying to make Congress work for the people despite these enormous challenges that we faced Harper noted that he was part of the Peace Corps and spent time as an HIV AIDS volunteer in Malawi before running McCollum s 2000 congressional campaign Said McCollum If anybody would have told us when we first met working on the campaign that 23 years later we would still be working together we both would have just laughed out loud She said Harper is someone who does his homework knows what he s talking about and has a very reassuring presence When he says he s going to do something he s going to do it and he s a man of his word And so that s how he s earned so much respect over the years McCollum said During their time working together McCollum has gone from freshman lawmaker to dean of Minnesota s congressional delegation In November she won a 12th term while Democrats narrowly lost control of the U S House McCollum has wielded major influence in the past two years while leading the House Appropriations subcommittee handling defense spending When you re at this level you take the partisanship out of the equation and you focus on This is about America this is about our country Harper said Democratic U S Rep Dean Phillips called Harper one of the most connected principled honorable and effective Capitol Hill staffers that I know of Looking back Harper said the accomplishment that makes him proudest is his work with McCollum on President George W Bush s emergency plan for AIDS relief in 2003 We secured language for orphans and vulnerable children he said McCollum s office said in a news release when Harper s exit was announced that he will continue to work as a political adviser for the longtime Democratic lawmaker Harper said he s interested in using his experience and skills to work with nonprofits and businesses to help them advance their missions particularly in the federal space As he prepares to leave Congress behind Harper said that as powerful as Washington and Congress may be we are a direct extension of the people And it needs to stay that way
167	Mr Speaker today I rise to honor Captain Thomas F Mantell Jr of Simpson County Kentucky who was killed while serving in the Kentucky Air National Guard on January 7 1948 Earlier that day an unidentified flying object was reported in several locations in Kentucky and Ohio Despite the dangerous nature of the mission Captain Mantell heroically pursued the object and paid the ultimate sacrifice while in pursuit His death was the first of the Kentucky Air National Guard Captain Mantell also served as a decorated officer in the Army Air Corps flying missions over Normandy and on D day For his service during World War II he received the Distinguished Flying Cross for heroism In the years since Captain Mantell s untimely death the people of Simpson County have kept his memory alive A memorial was dedicated in his honor in 2001 and commemorations to mark the 75th anniversary will take place this year I join the people of Simpson County in remembrance and gratitude for his bravery while carrying out his final mission
168	Mr Speaker today I introduce the District of Columbia Legislative Home Rule Act which would eliminate the congressional review period for D C legislation D C legislation takes effect after a congressional review period unless a joint resolution of disapproval is enacted into law during the review period The review period imposes significant costs on both D C and Congress but only 3 disapproval resolutions on D C legislation have been enacted since passage of the D C Home Rule Act in 1973 and none since 1991 Yet the D C Council has had to develop a Kafkaesque legislative process to comply with the review period often having to pass the same bill multiple times Congress loses nothing by eliminating the review period Congress can legislate on any D C matter at any time and has done so many times outside of the review period such as through the appropriations process The congressional review period 30 days for civil bills and 60 days for criminal bills is based on legislative days not calendar days often delaying D C bills from becoming law for many months The delay forces the D C Council to pass most bills several times using a cumbersome and complicated process to ensure that the operations of this large city continue uninterrupted Placing a congressional hold on D C bills has not only proven unnecessary but has imposed costs on the D C government residents and businesses D C residents and businesses are placed on hold because they have no certainty when D C bills from taxes to regulations will take effect making it difficult to plan It is particularly unfair to require the D C Council to engage in this unnecessary labor intensive and costly process Last Congress the House Committee on Oversight and Reform passed this bill as part of my District of Columbia Home Rule Expansion Act of 2022 I urge my colleagues to support this good government measure

171	Mr Speaker today I reintroduce the Clean Water SRF Parity Act with Congressman Mike Bost R IL This legislation would make nonprofit cooperatives and publicly regulated utilities operating wastewater treatment plants eligible under the Clean Water Act s State Revolving Loan Funds These same entities are already eligible under the Safe Drinking Water Act s State Revolving Loan Funds and by extension the U S Environmental Protection Agency s Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act WIFIA revolving loan fund For 2022 California s State Water Resources Control Board awarded 2 7 billion for drinking water and wastewater treatment projects According to most recent Clean Watersheds Needs Survey California needs an estimated 26 2 billion in federal state and local investment for wastewater treatment wastewater recycling and stormwater pollution prevention infrastructure over the next 20 years This includes an estimated 24 4 billion needed to modernize aging water infrastructure across the state Under the federal Clean Water Act each state capitalizes its own State Revolving Loan Fund to provide public financing and grants for wastewater water reuse stormwater and surface water pollution reduction projects to keep our nation s waterways clean Since this public financing is paid back with interest to help recapitalize each State s State Revolving Loan Funds there is no net cost to American taxpayers Our bill restricts eligibility for publicly regulated utilities to the amounts greater than the 1 638 826 000 appropriated for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund program in fiscal years 2020 and 2021 That way we ensure that this new eligibility for nonprofit cooperatives and publicly regulated utilities does not come at the cost of municipally owned utilities and public projects under the program As a senior member of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure which authorizes all Clean Water Act programs I strongly support increased federal funding for the State Revolving Fund program The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act Public Law 117 58 of which I am an original cosponsor provided more than 11 7 billion in new federal funding for the Clean Water State Revolving Funds nationwide With enactment of the Clean Water SRF Parity Act I expect the National Association of Water Companies Council of Infrastructure Financing Authorities Utility Workers Union of America AFL CIO and American Public Works Association to advocate for increased federal funding for the Clean Water State Revolving Funds each year Mr Speaker I encourage all Members of the House to cosponsor this bipartisan noncontroversial bill

174	Mr Speaker it s appropriate for me to republish my statement of March 11 2019 on the meaning of cosponsoring legislation Much of that statement was a republication of my statement of September 29 2010 as I ve maintained a consistent policy on this issue The following is a republication of my statement of March 11 2019 Mr. Speaker on Wednesday September 29 2010 stated for the Record Mr. Speaker I wish to clarify that when I cosponsor a bill it does not necessarily mean that I agree with every part of it At a minimum my cosponsorship indicates that I support moving the bill forward through the legislative process including being marked up in committee and if sent to the floor by the relevant committee s then subject to consideration and amendment on the floor Let me reiterate that 2010 statement and provide additional background I believe in the legislative process I believe bills are improved during committee mark ups and by consideration of amendments on the floor The effect of cosponsoring a bill is to signal to the relevant committee chair s that I believe the bill should be marked up in committee a process that may well improve the bill and in some cases may make the bill worse When I decide to cosponsor a bill after it has completed the committee process I do signal to the Speaker and Rules Committee that I believe the bill should be considered on the floor and almost always under an open rule

183	Mr Speaker words matter and ideas have consequences That is why House Republicans are once again changing the name of the committee I now chair to the Committee on Education and the Workforce Every time Democrats take control of the House they swap out the word workforce for labor This back and forth is at the core of Republicans and Democrats differing views on the concept of work The Bible tells us that when God created Adam and Eve He gave them the garden to cultivate and animals to name This was work Being made in the image of God means that we like Him have the capacity to build create and bring order from chaos Using our God given gifts mankind has done just that This ability to work and create is something to celebrate not lament Influenced by Marxism the left prefers to call work labor This is a mistake I reject the idea that work freely done is toil I reject the idea that work freely done is a curse I embrace the idea that having the opportunity to provide for one s family is a blessing Even those who do not adhere to a Biblical worldview can see empirically that men and women are at their best when they get to work Work is fundamental to a lasting sense of fulfillment As a small business owner myself I know there is nothing better than the feeling you get when you look at something you have built with your own hands and ingenuity I also prefer the word workforce over labor because all work is of equal value When the left refers to labor they aren t talking about the work of lawyers and doctors but the work of mechanics and welders Why For several decades now our culture has made a distinction between blue collar and white collar work that denigrates the former This is wrong Calling the men and women who keep our homes heated and our cars running laborers degrades their contribution to society We must recognize that there is more than one path to the American Dream Working in a high rise office building is not of greater value than the window washer cleaning that building Each plays a pivotal role in keeping our economy running Labor also implies that workers do not have a choice in who they work for or what conditions they work in In the United States we live in a free society and workers have freedom to choose for whom they work If an employer is unfair or unjust workers have the freedom to find a different employer and to seek recompense Yet the left uses the word labor to pit workers against employers all in the hopes of bringing about more government control and a radical redistribution of wealth The United States is the most prosperous country in history because of our free market but embracing socialist policies and views would destroy that Democrats also insist on using the word labor because they are beholden to Big Labor Democrats have made it clear that they wish to force all Americans into unions regardless of their preference When Democrats oversee this committee their efforts focus on bolstering union bosses at the expense of employee free choice This myopic view serves only a small spectrum of the workforce as the majority of workers choose not to be in a union On the other hand Republicans are committed to supporting the entire workforce We do not support a one size fits all work model and understand that work is as diverse as the people doing it So when I talk about the workforce I am talking about all the men and women who take pride in their work When I talk about the workforce I am talking about all the men and women who work hard to provide for their families When I talk about the workforce I am talking about all the men and women who have gained the skills necessary to be productive and self sufficient citizens Under my leadership the Committee on Education and the Workforce will serve the entire workforce no matter what color their collar is how dirty their hands get when they work or whether they work independently The end of Big Labor in our hearing room is over
184	Mr Speaker yesterday after 4 1 2 days and 15 votes to find a Speaker we started with our business by passing rules The Republican rules and first day s activities were to help the rich and the powerful avoid taxes The government like any entity just like any business has to have revenue When people don t pay their fair share they are cheating They are committing crimes They are defrauding their fellow citizens because their fellow citizens either have to pay more money to make up the differences or they don t get services that they otherwise would be provided through the government By revoking all of those monies to the IRS to hire new employees they are giving wealthy corporations and wealthy individuals like Donald Trump who had only one auditor looking at his return which was not looked at within the time period it was supposed to be looked at under the law the policy of the government at the time they are giving those people an open door to continue to make their IRS payments really not payments but their first offers That is what they do It is not filing your return It is filing your first offer So if they get away with that which I don t think they will in the Senate they are depriving the middle class who they said they are trying to support services and fairness and the middle class will have to pay more money because it is the wealthy and the higher corporations that get away with fraudulent returns Then they are talking about banning or protesting through H Con Res 3 violence against pro life centers anti abortion centers I hope everybody in the House is against violence against those facilities But there is nothing in there about violence against Planned Parenthood or abortion provider facilities Both are equally as anti American and wrong as the other but there is nothing about that So we are seeing a very slanted agenda and there is no opportunity to amend that resolution Even though they talked about an amendment process to give everybody an opportunity it is really kind of transparency ish but not transparency and not open It is not openness it is open ish You have got to look closely at what is going on here There are a lot of things that look good on the front but really aren t fair and right to the majority of the people Much of what is projected here is to try to maintain the status quo in the name of freedom It is the freedom of people not to comply with Federal Government laws and regulations It is the freedom to basically live independent of the law and independent of the Federal government and attempts to starve the Federal Government of the revenue it needs The bill yesterday would increase the debt by over 100 billion That is not fiscal conservativeness That is trying to starve the Federal Government

187	Mr Speaker this week we will take historic steps to reverse the crises created by President Biden s administration and fulfill our Commitment to America For the past 2 years the Biden administration has chosen to appease the radical left that continues to undermine American families Now it is time to turn the page It is time to return to serving the American people Pennsylvania families need results They do not need empty promises That is why on day one we voted to stop IRS agents from going after small businesses who are simply trying to follow the law That is why we will vote to keep American oil from being sold to the Chinese Communist Party That is why we will vote to support our law enforcement and send the clearest message yet that Republicans will never allow the far left to defund the police And we will vote to save the lives of unborn children by finally passing the Born Alive Survivors Protection Act These pieces of legislation are the beginning of enacting our Commitment to America It is time to build an economy that is strong it is time to fortify a Nation that is safe and it is time to deliver a government that is accountable That is our commitment to Pennsylvanian families That is our Commitment to America
188	Mr Speaker I rise today in support of the Protecting America s Strategic Petroleum Reserve from China Act which will work to unleash American energy dominance In an election year gimmick President Biden raided oil from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve depleting it to its lowest level in decades and allowing it to be sold to a company affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party Selling off American oil to the Chinese Communist Party for its own strategic use poses a direct threat to our national security The petroleum reserve is our insurance card It is to be used to protect our great country during national emergencies or weather events Depleting it is dangerous and restocking it at higher prices is foolish Let s restore some sanity here Protect America and end the foolish practice of sending oil to our enemies that would hate us for free Mr Speaker I urge the House to pass this important legislation this week to stop this reckless America last practice from happening again Congratulating the Alleghany High School Girls Cross Country Team

190	Mr Speaker we have right now a situation where the President is visiting the border In my line of work as a young lieutenant I flew along the border and knew that there was a problem in the early 1990s As a matter of fact in the mid 1990s as a forward air controller we had to stop operations at nighttime as vans bouncing around in the middle of our operations made us cease fire so we could chase illegal immigrants out of our firing ranges Then as an emergency medicine doctor I treated patients who came here illegally Most people don t realize the consequence of our actions of our poor border security and what it has done We understand the numbers We understand the millions that are coming across the border 4 million since we have had a new President but not the downwind consequences when you provide laws that encourage bad behavior and punish good behavior One of the things that most people don t realize is that when you go to the emergency room and are waiting in line behind a lot of people who came here illegally you are not only waiting in line behind them but you are also paying for their bills Many people are coming across the border to receive treatment for their chronic illnesses that cost millions of dollars per year and those are several patients per hospital We are talking about billions even tens of billions of dollars spent on people who come here illegally It comes from taxpayer money both out of your pocket and through your taxation which adds to our debt which of course is going to be paid for by our children To make it worse we punish those people who come here the right way In my district we have a huge immigrant population people who come here from all over the world whether it be India Europe South America and they have to wait in line with a glutted immigration policy that makes it very difficult for them to follow the law Meanwhile we reward those people who break the law I think we need to change our laws I think we need to make it more streamlined for people who follow the law who are good citizens who paid their taxes who have jobs who create jobs and make it more difficult for people who break laws I think right now when you talk about the overwhelming number of people coming across the border and when you have the President go down there and have the borders cleaned up so he can view something that doesn t really exist which is a problem where we don t protect our sovereign border which is one of the President s main responsibilities where you have people s property violated where you have people s rights violated where you have crimes Of course as an emergency medicine physician this last year I lost four patients who came in from fentanyl overdoses that I was not able to revive Now almost every single night I do revive somebody so it is something I literally witness almost every single shift usually several times per shift The opioid crisis is real and it is something that is killing over 100 000 Americans per year Every year we are setting a new record and we have done nothing of consequence to really stem that tide I think it is with the greatest earnest appeal to my fellow Republicans and Democrats that we watch after our own house It is okay to be compassionate It is okay to reach out and help people but we have to do it the right way Most importantly we have to make laws that encourage good behavior that people coming here are rewarded for following the laws They are rewarded with citizenship when they do the right thing and we are punishing people who come here with ill intent Finally I would like to point out that we are experiencing diseases here in America we haven t seen in decades Where is it coming from It is because we don t have good screening procedures It used to be to come to America you couldn t even come here if you had glaucoma Now you can come here with every kind of disease process there is and we will never even know that you are even here If you look at the terrorists coming across the border we know that we have at least nine terrorists we have caught in the last month but we don t know how many got away It is because we have poor border security So it is not just for one thing it is for many things that we need to secure our border make sure that we are a sovereign Nation and follow the law

197	Mr Speaker as we have observed Western States are receiving much welcomed rainfall and snowpack Indeed some of the side effects are flooding and there are many mudslides that are affecting communities and transportation corridors This is on the heels of short rainfall years for at least the last 3 years This year rainfall numbers are good They are at a pace where they are at their historical average or a little above in some areas This is historical average long term over non drought years The last 3 years have seen dire water supplies for many people and allocations for farmers In 2019 our lakes in California were basically full You may recall in 2017 in my district Lake Oroville had the spillway collapse due to lack of maintenance and checking its integrity over the years but it was plumb full 101 percent full in 2017 Our water projects in California were designed with the idea that they withstand 5 years of drought With Lake Oroville being full as recently as 2019 and Lake Shasta nearly full as well how is it that our State water projects and our Central Valley projects which are run by the Bureau of Reclamation being at these high levels that Lake Oroville for example in 2021 only 2 years after being full was basically so low on water that for the first time in the history of that lake it did not make hydroelectric power because the water levels were so low Lake Shasta in 2022 an unprecedented cut in water supply including to its neighbor right there in Shasta County Anderson Cottonwood Irrigation District received zero allocation because they couldn t deliver enough water to make it worth their while In over 100 years of the existence of that district this is the first time that they did not get to irrigate it These two dams were designed to withstand 5 years of drought being full as recently as 2019 We had one running out in 2021 and the other basically being useless almost to agriculture in 2022 with drastic cuts all up and down the Sacramento River system What is going on here What is the State Water Project doing on the Feather River side et cetera What is the Federal Bureau of Reclamation and CDP doing on the Sacramento River side that has changed They are not doing everything they can to hold water even in drought years that they could be holding Why It is a mystery We have the opportunity right now with these high flows We have areas of California right in the Sacramento Valley that are being flooded out They are running the pumps that are at the south end of the delta at about 18 percent on the State side and about 67 percent not so bad on the Federal level instead of taking full advantage of running those pumps as hard as they can and taking this excess water and relieving some of the flooding and putting it into a reservoir that will help our whole State withstand possible drought in the future Is this a drought year No not as defined by lack of rainfall as indeed we are at average or we are above average in some areas With the projection in January for a lot more rain coming we might have a full normal water year or above That would be good Our leaders in government in the agencies don t seem to feel the same urgency At the same time they are talking that we have flood emergencies they are still maintaining we have drought emergencies not with this kind of rainfall Yes we have low lake problems but that isn t how you define a drought That is how you define lake management That is how you define water management It is not helping We need to be running at least those two sets of pumps at 99 percent or 100 percent at the delta and filling up the San Luis Reservoir and allocating water to those recharge basins so the subsidence we are having in the San Joaquin Valley that everybody is worried about wouldn t be happening No they want to just keep chugging along the way they are doing especially on the State side This is a disservice to all water users in California At the same time they don t really see a whole lot of need to cut back on environmental water that is very dubious in nature if it is helping fish in the delta or anywhere else Indeed they need a change of attitude at all of these levels of water management These agencies don t seem to be on the side of growing food I always bring this poster along so people can understand how much of their food is grown in California a high percentage of these crops that only come from California that Americans consume If it is not grown in California either you are not going to have it or you are going to have to import it from somewhere else Look at this walnuts Walnuts are having a devil of a time right now in their market Tomatoes If you want tomato paste for your pizza and your pasta where is it going to come from We are going to have to import all this stuff We need to have a much stronger and much smarter water policy and that starts right in California and it benefits the whole country
198	Mr Speaker I rise today for the unborn for the protection and the defense of the most vulnerable among us I stand here today because this week the Republican majority is doing what the previous Congress refused to do and that is uphold the right to life For far too long we have seen pro life facilities vandalized and broken into For far too long we have watched as Democrats refuse to protect born alive babies Think about that for a moment These babies are born alive breathing outside the womb and the Democrats want to kill them They do not protect them This week we right those wrongs and we defend life in America It is well past time for the United States Congress for this body to uphold the guarantees laid out in the Declaration of Independence that we are endowed by our creator with the unalienable right to life

200	Mr Speaker victims of disaster don t need to be hassled by government especially by new taxes The 2018 Camp fire in California was the deadliest and most destructive in our State s history The Fire Victim Trust was set up to compensate these people for their loss and help them rebuild their homes and their lives However these fire victims had to deal with the possibility that some of their settlement money and money for attorney s fees that they would pay would be taxed as income by the IRS To prevent the further victimization of these folks who lost so much already Representative Thompson and I have introduced a bill to exempt payments from the Fire Victim Trust from being taxed by the IRS The bill received bipartisan support in the House and Senate but was not included in the end of session vehicle last year unfortunately So getting this bill passed and signed into law is very important and right The survivors need this money to help get their lives going again They don t need the government as a partner in the middle taking their cut It is essential we act quickly so that they can get back to their lives and get the dollars moving toward rebuilding their homes and whatever it is they need from having suffered this already
201	Mr Speaker the United States and Canada enjoy a shared border and shared values We are friends and trading partners Unfortunately in recent years we have seen a layering of restrictions that hinder binational movement This not only makes it hard to cross a bridge but it hinders binational cooperation It separates us from one another It stifles trade and diminishes life quality Confusion hassles and delays prevent travel and inhibit travel plans As President Biden and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau meet today to discuss our future I urge them to leverage our strengths to craft solutions that make it easier for us to connect between two countries fostering better connections a better economy and a better life quality
202	Mr Speaker I am grateful that with a new Congress is new leadership Congratulations to Speaker Kevin McCarthy Speaker McCarthy has a proven record of accomplishments for the American people and his leadership will be enhanced with Majority Leader Steve Scalise Majority Whip Tom Emmer Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik Republican Conference Vice Chair Mike Johnson National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Richard Hudson and Policy Committee Chairman Gary Palmer The Republican majority will immediately begin to implement the Commitment to America that Speaker McCarthy coordinated with input from across the country It promotes an economy that is strong a Nation that is safe a future that is built on freedom and a government that is accountable Legislation begins with the Family and Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act which defunds Biden s army of 87 000 new IRS agents In conclusion God bless our troops who have successfully protected America for 20 years in the global war on terrorism as it continues from Afghanistan s safe haven to America Our sympathy to the family of magnificent Lynette Diamond Hardaway of North Carolina and we welcome Delegate Jim Moylan of Guam

204	Mr Speaker we recently learned that the Biden administration is considering funding mining projects abroad with American tax dollars in order to address our country s mineral supply concerns Mr Speaker we have seen this movie before President Biden looks to other countries to meet our country s energy needs while our domestic industries are blocked by unnecessary permitting delays and regulatory uncertainty If I may offer a suggestion to both the President and my Democratic colleagues why not in America In my home State of Idaho we have an abundance of resources including cobalt gold silver tungsten and antimony These resources are necessary for the production of batteries semiconductors munitions and countless other essential products Instead of looking at countries with hostile motives against America like Russia and China to help us meet our demand for critical minerals we should strengthen our domestic supply chain by enabling the responsible development of our resources at home

210	Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr Speaker I rise in strong support of H Res 11 a resolution Establishing the Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party This select committee will be charged with addressing the urgent threat to the United States and our allies posed by the Chinese Communist Party Mr Speaker the ongoing threat posed by Communist China and the fact that the CCP cannot be trusted as a global party has been apparent to the American people for some time In 2019 at the behest of then Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy House Republicans created the China Task Force to review Communist China s actions and to make policy recommendations to protect U S interests against the Chinese Communist Party Republicans sought to make this task force bipartisan and extended an open invitation to Democrats to join us Unfortunately House Democrats chose not to participate at that time I hope they do at this time The China Task Force ultimately produced a report with more than 400 policy recommendations many of them bipartisan Today we are taking the next logical step with the creation of a select committee empowered to investigate and respond to the counterintelligence and economic espionage threat that threatens our very way of life Make no mistake Mr Speaker the Chinese Communist Party has demonstrated time and time again that it is more interested in being America s foe than America s friend The events of the past 3 years have brought into stark focus how Communist China s actions affect the United States and the rest of the world Since the COVID 19 pandemic began inside China s borders the world has experienced constant disruptions and chaos Indeed Communist China s approach to the COVID 19 pandemic is emblematic of its approach to many other things attempting to cover up the pandemic s existence resisting all efforts to investigate its origins committing horrific human rights abuses and refusing to work productively with the global community to combat the pandemic It has also become apparent that far too many economically critical supply chains are tied to China which threatens our economic and national security We are dangerously dependent on China for basic building blocks of our economy The result is shortages of critical products like semiconductors and rare earth minerals both of which are largely produced in China today along with the shortages of pharmaceuticals and personal protective equipment which threatens our ability to battle future pandemics Our national and economic security requires us to secure our vulnerable supply chains and indeed to bring them back home to America Communist China has also undertaken aggressive actions designed to expand their influence both in the United States and abroad Communist China is a prolific thief of American intellectual property violating countless patents and failing to respect international and domestic intellectual property laws They have undertaken a systematic effort to infiltrate American colleges and universities through their support of the so called Confucius Institutes and other organizations designed to spread Chinese propaganda Chinese spy networks operate both on American soil and in cyberspace And popular Chinese owned apps like TikTok spread more propaganda and take massive amounts of Americans personal data back to the Chinese Government In addition the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative has spread the tentacles of the so called People s Liberation Army throughout the world particularly the developing world and has ensnared dozens of developing countries in debt trap diplomacy Communist China continues to aggressively push into the South China Sea and militarize small islands threatening freedom of navigation in this strategically important region They relentlessly and aggressively provoke Taiwan an island that demonstrates to the world what a free democratic and capitalist China could look like Mr Speaker the bottom line is Communist China is a serious generational threat that we must address before it is too late China exhibits expanding economic and military power coupled with the uncompromising rejection of our values and those of our allies That is why the Select Committee on Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party is so critical It will be charged with reviewing our economic dependence on China and restoring safe and secure supply chains on reviewing China s actions toward the United States and our allies on restoring American domestic institutions to protect them against Chinese infiltration and propaganda and so much more Mr Speaker I urge all Members on both sides of the aisle to join me in support of this resolution so we can stand united against Communist China Mr Speaker I reserve the balance of my time
211	Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr Speaker I think before I begin I would just like to ask any of my Republican colleagues whether anybody found the secret three page memo detailing all the concessions that were made to the most extreme elements of their Republican Conference Anyone Mr Speaker I heard that Speaker McCarthy told Members during a closed conference meeting that there is no official document or three page addendum to the House rules package detailing these concessions None of us ever said it was official If it was official it would have been in the official rules package I also took note of the fact that in Axios today we saw this It says One thing the document doesn t contain according to NRCC Chair Richard Hudson who said he s seen it is promised committee chairmanships for specific Members No names just representation on panels So we were able to find out from Mr Hudson what is not in that secret memo but it would be helpful maybe before the end of the day if we could actually get the document so that the American people know what was promised Mr Speaker China has the second largest economy in the world and there is no doubt that their government seeks to extend their sphere of influence and export their model of authoritarianism abroad The question is How should the United States respond For the past 4 years I have served as chair and co chair of the Congressional Executive Commission on China We have monitored China s compliance with international human rights and rule of law standards Under my leadership alongside Senators Jeff Merkley Marco Rubio and Congressman Chris Smith the Commission has continued to draw attention to the Chinese Government s human rights violations and technology enhanced authoritarianism We passed my bill the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act which seeks to address the genocide in Xinjiang and we hope can serve as a model for future human rights legislation We passed the Tibet Policy and Support Act to support the people of Tibet in their struggle against Chinese repression and the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act to require the U S Government to impose sanctions against mainland China and Hong Kong officials considered responsible for human rights abuses in Hong Kong Now everything that we accomplished at the CECC has been because that Commission operates in a bipartisan manner with nonpartisan staff Our comprehensive annual reports are widely respected by government officials academics and the advocacy community because they are well researched and they are fact based That brings us to today Mr Speaker we are here to consider the creation of a select committee This select committee on China would investigate and submit policy recommendations on the status of China s economic technological and security progress as well as its ongoing competition with the United States I will be honest I have reservations here Many of us have concerns about this turning into a committee that focuses on pushing Republican conspiracy theories and partisan talking points We certainly don t want it to turn into a place that perpetuates anti Asian hate We cannot and will not tolerate that But instead I would hope that this new committee would work in a similar fashion as the CECC producing bipartisan work with a fact based tone and approach that could be received by the international community seriously and substantively There are a few things that I think the select committee needs to keep in mind if they truly want to be effective First President Trump repeatedly mislabeled COVID with racist language Such rhetoric coincided with spikes in hate based acts of violence and discrimination against people of Chinese or Asian origin across the country This language has no place on this committee or anywhere in Congress Second this committee should not seek to focus solely on military solutions Yes China s military modernization is a legitimate issue but that does not demand a military first policy response Third I am concerned that a committee focused myopically on the economic technological and security challenges of China could distract us from the need to build a holistic approach in many of these policy areas We need to remember that the United States faces economic technological and security challenges from many different regions across the globe not just China To focus solely on China whether it be policy related to trade technology authoritarianism or anything else is neither analytically sound nor effective Fourth and finally the gentleman from Wisconsin Mr Gallagher said if he were to chair this committee he would focus on ideological competition and human rights I would just like to say that human rights are not ideological Human rights are fundamental and universal protected by a vast body of international law codified at the United Nations and widely adjudicated They apply to every person in every country and territory on Earth It is the Chinese Communist Party in fact that portrays human rights along an ideological divide That falsely portrays Chinese values as something distinct from Western values in an effort to justify its repression of the people of China It is important that the committee does not adopt the rhetoric of Chinese officials While I do have concerns here after reading the resolution itself I will be voting yes The Democratic Party has led the way in implementing efforts to monitor China s compliance with international human rights and rule of law standards and we will continue to do so here Mr Speaker I reserve the balance of my time
212	Mr Speaker one of the greatest worries about the future is that we fall behind Communist China The fact of the matter is the danger posed by our dependence on China is dire We spent decades passing policies that welcomed China into the global system In return China has exported oppression aggression and anti Americanism Today the power of its military and economy are growing at the expense of freedom and democracy worldwide It didn t start under this administration but the current administration has clearly made it worse Their policies have weakened our economy and made us more vulnerable to the threats of the CCP But here is the good news There is bipartisan consensus that the era of trusting Communist China is over I listened to my friend the gentleman across the aisle I listened to your points to your concerns Do not be concerned Those are my same concerns as well and they will not take place I will tell the gentleman where the idea of all this was created It was on a codel to Normandy I was there with then Speaker Nancy Pelosi celebrating the 75th anniversary of D day As you walked those hallowed grounds of the crosses and the Stars of David of these young American men and you wondered What could have been done for that day to have never taken place It dawned on me in that moment in time there was an opportunity that instead of American Government not speaking with one voice these different messages we have been providing perhaps we could have a bipartisan committee that could look at all aspects from economics when we fell into COVID and not knowing whether we could have our medical supplies because China controlled so much We learned of the farmland they are buying today and the stealing of our intellectual property But we weaken ourselves when we fight about which way to do it Wouldn t it be better if we all came together For 9 months we worked on that and we did get an agreement that we were going to start a bipartisan task force We even had The Washington Post come in and interview the Members who were going to be on it but unfortunately the night before the then majority party pulled back Mr Speaker you have my word and my commitment that this is not a partisan committee This will be a bipartisan committee It is my hope my desire and my wish that we speak with one voice and that we focus on the challenges that we have of how do we bring our jobs back from China to America How do we secure our intellectual property How do we make sure our farmland is protected All of that would be brought up within this committee The threat is too great for us to bicker with ourselves The future should be determined by us I have heard my colleagues on both sides say that the threat posed by Communist China is serious I fully agree This is an issue that transcends our political parties and creating the select committee on China is our best avenue for addressing it If we want to end our dependence on China then this committee will investigate it If we want to protect our national security then this committee will work to do that If we want to stop the theft of intellectual property and bring supply chains back to America then this committee will work to make it happen If we are worried about Chinese propaganda in our schools and lobbying efforts in Washington then this committee will shine a bright light on it If we are outraged that the CCP is buying American farmland then this committee will work to stop it but to stop it with one voice It is not one party saying it It is America united determining our own future If we want to stop trillions of American dollars from financing Communist genocide and military modernization then the committee will work to prevent it including by investigating how ESG benefits the CCP The select committee on China will create the plan that will take us where we really need to go It will get us all on the same page and move us in the right direction Members of the select committee will work closely with their colleagues on every committee to get the job done Is it partisan Absolutely not To my friend across the aisle if at any time on the five items you listed that you feel something is challenging those then you come to me because that is not the intent and that is not what I will put up with I sat with the new leader of the Democrats and I told him early on what this committee will be and whom we will be putting on it We want serious lawmakers This isn t for somebody to go in and be viral because they want to make some point This is to work together as one Congress where one of our greatest challenges for the future is that no longer will we be dependent upon China and no longer will we be as vulnerable America will be stronger and dependent upon ourselves and we will do this together That is what the American people expect I want this committee to last beyond who is in the majority and never ever be decided that this is a partisan committee The gentleman has my commitment If at any time I feel that whoever the leader on the other side puts on this committee was trying to make it partisan I told him I would approach him Let s start with the right philosophy and with the right goals in mind and let s work together to make it happen The chairman will be Mike Gallagher This is a man who has sacrificed a lot This is a man who is focused and studied This is a man who is not going to be partisan We want the very best ideas It doesn t matter where they come from At the end of the day we don t need a majority and minority report We just need one philosophy with one principle and America will be stronger for the future to come Mr Speaker I thank the gentleman for his support I appreciate it
213	Mr Speaker I thank my good friend from Massachusetts Mr McGovern for yielding Mr Speaker I rise today to talk about the select committee on China and to support this select committee on China These past two Congresses I have had the privilege of being the chairman on the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific and a senior member on the Foreign Affairs Committee I have worked very closely with my ranking member Steve Chabot a good friend whom we are going to miss but I also served as ranking member when Mr Chabot was chairman on that committee We learned a lot on how we should approach China We have looked at supply chains We have traveled to the region We have talked to our partners in southeast Asia and ASEAN We have understood the vulnerabilities Our subcommittee had the first hearing on the novel coronavirus back in February of 2020 when we didn t have a name on it So we understand the importance as a doctor of understanding the origins of COVID where it came and how we can best prevent the next pandemic None of those questions are ones that we should be looking at and bickering about as Democratic or Republican questions Those are questions that just make a lot of sense to our security our economic strength and where we go from here So I applaud the Speaker s comments on wanting this to be an American strategy not a Democratic or Republican strategy If we look at our own history what served us well in the Cold War is we had an American strategy It didn t change every 2 years It didn t change with the new Presidential administration We acted on it we laid it out there we executed it and we won the Cold War without going to war That is what the challenge is that faces us today I wish China had gone a different direction I wish they had opened up I applaud the work that Mr McGovern does on human rights and addressing the Uyghur genocide Speaker Emerita Pelosi has been a champion on looking at the human rights abuses and the tragedy that is taking place in Tibet Those are all issues that we should come together on not just the United States of America but with our allies and friends because they have the same concerns I don t want to say we are in a new cold war but we are in a real challenge right now So I support the select committee Let s make it nonpartisan and let s work together to create an American strategy
214	Mr Speaker I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his leadership Mr Speaker I rise today in strong support of H Res 11 establishing a bipartisan Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party In 1946 a great Wisconsinite George Kennan argued that dealing with the Soviet threat was the greatest task our diplomacy has ever faced and probably the greatest it will ever have to face Today due to its aggression and its economic strength and our unique economic entanglement with it the Chinese Communist Party represents an even greater test for American diplomacy As Secretary of State Anthony Blinken put it last year China is the only country with both the intent to reshape the international order and increasingly the economic diplomatic military and technological power to do it The threat posed by the CCP is not abstract The CCP s aggression is not limited to Taiwan the South China Sea Hong Kong or even Xinjiang where two successive administrations Republican and Democratic alike have determined that the CCP is engaging in genocide We see this aggression here at home where the party has stolen American intellectual property technology and industrial capacity undermining our economy and good paying American jobs It is here at home where the party s extraterritorial totalitarianism terrorizes Chinese students studying at our universities and targets Americans of Chinese descent And it is here at home where thousands of Americans are poisoned each year by fentanyl precursors manufactured in China and distributed thanks to a complex Chinese money laundering network It is time to understand the urgency of the threat It is time to reclaim our economic independence in key areas The select committee will expose the CCP s coordinated whole of society strategy to undermine American leadership and American sovereignty while working on a bipartisan basis and with the committees of jurisdiction to identify long overdue commonsense approaches to counter CCP aggression I stress working on a bipartisan basis because that is the only way we are going to be successful over the long term The CCP doesn t pose a danger to just Republicans or Democrats It is a threat to all Americans Mr Speaker I commend my colleague for his work on the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act That is one of the most consequential and significant pieces of legislation that we passed on a bipartisan basis in recent years It is up to us to ensure that it is fully implemented and there is much work to be done on that front We need to have a united front here in Congress to counter the Chinese Communist Party and in so doing at every step along the way we must make sure that we are drawing a distinction between the party and the Chinese people with whom we have no quarrel and who are often the primary victims of CCP aggression and repression In sum there is no more critical challenge facing our Nation today I am grateful to Speaker McCarthy for his leadership and establishing this select committee for giving me the mission of ensuring this stays bipartisan We heard his sincerity in wanting this to be an area where Republicans and Democrats can work together I would also like to thank Chairman Mike McCaul who chaired the China task force and did a phenomenal job We are building upon the foundation that he laid with the China task force I look forward to working with him as this effort moves forward Mr Speaker I urge my colleagues to support this critical legislation I look forward to working with my Democratic colleagues I see many friends sitting on the other side of the Chamber
215	Mr Speaker I rise in support of the creation of the Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party I rise as a research scientist who has participated in many international collaborations which included some brilliant Chinese scientists and I rise also as a businessman who founded a high tech manufacturing business that now provides over 1 000 good paying American manufacturing jobs and has kept those manufacturing jobs in America despite having to compete in the world markets with cloned Chinese products for over two decades I have watched with consternation as our businesses electronic supply chain has been increasingly dependent upon China Now it was not a stupid thing for our country and the countries of the free world to attempt to help China become a free and open country by integrating it into the international economy and into the international scientific research community and to open our doors to Chinese students and scholars In the years since World War II that approach has succeeded in turning many previously autocratic countries into free democracies around the world In fact in previous years China took a number of steps toward becoming a free and open country But in recent years it has turned back toward autocracy So it is time to respond to that reality and to take thoughtful action On a personal note my wife is Korean and is a scientist who has contributed at the highest levels of scientific research and science policy in the United States The only reason that she is free today is that two generations ago the U S and the free countries of the world stood up against Communism in Korea But nothing is more self defeating than the anti Asian racism that sometimes creeps into the debate in our country The frontiers that we should be defending are not the good old U S of A but the free democracies of the world So Mr Speaker I rise in support of this new Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party in particular in the clear distinction that it makes even in its title between the Communist Party of China and the people of China who are not the enemy
216	Mr Speaker the Chinese Communist Party is intent on replacing the United States as the world s preeminent economic military and technological power They have a sophisticated plan to challenge American hegemony and leverage every possible avenue to finance their goals Defending against these advances is one of the most significant geopolitical challenges of a generation Today the House led by Speaker Kevin McCarthy is voting to establish a select committee on China to do just that This select committee will examine the threats from the Chinese Communist Party with a fine tooth comb and expose them for the American people and for the whole world to fully understand In addition we will develop concrete solutions for how we can better position the United States to prevail in this competition and ensure that the 21st century is led by the United States and defined by a rules based international order The stakes are high and the CCP s list of offenses against the norms of international order is long violating an international treaty and dismantling Hong Kong s civil liberties egregious zero tolerance COVID 19 restrictions in mainland China that led to mass protests with brutal crackdowns from CCP authorities oppressing ethnic minorities persecuting Uyghurs and Tibetans conducting increasingly belligerent provocations on land and air and in cyberspace using debt trap diplomacy through the Belt and Road Initiative to assert colonial dominance over lesser developed countries engaging in economic warfare through unfair trade practices the theft of 600 billion of intellectual property from American businesses each year through the forced transfer of technology and threatening through military economic and diplomatic coercion the democracy in Taiwan Last year and the year before the threat from the CCP came into focus when the CCP silenced doctors and corrupted the World Health Organization to spread disinformation and cover up substandard biosecurity at the Wuhan Institute of Virology leading to a deadly virus becoming a global pandemic killing millions devastating the global economy and giving the CCP the opportunity to weaponize the global supply chain against the West Many Americans may not be aware that Beijing s malign activities are fueled in part by unwitting American investors In 2020 120 billion of U S foreign direct investment flowed into China from American businesses and investors Mr Speaker the United States is the economic envy of the world because we possess a capitalist free market economy the deepest most competitive liquid capital markets on planet Earth This empowers individual investors and businesses to make decisions for themselves but we cannot allow Wall Street banks asset managers and global equity index providers to fuel the rise of the CCP military and surveillance companies hell bent on targeting Americans These companies pose an imminent and growing threat to American national security and the security of our allies That is why I will be reintroducing the Chinese Military and Surveillance Company Sanctions Act of 2021 in the 118th Congress legislation that uses the economic power of the United States through OFAC to sanction Chinese companies that threaten U S national security I commend Speaker McCarthy for following through on his promise to create the select committee and for naming Congressman Mike Gallagher chairman of the committee He has been a fighter on the front lines and will do a great job leading this committee I will close with this Every President from Harry Truman to George H W Bush understood the need to confront the threat from the Soviet Union and defend the United States and our principles against communism Because of that bipartisan commitment and because of the strength and vitality of the American system our Nation was victorious in the Cold War We must come together again as Republicans and Democrats to confront this new threat
217	Mr Speaker I appreciate the gentleman s courtesy in permitting me to speak on this Mr Speaker I come to the floor much encouraged having heard the words of the Speaker and the chairman designate Mr Gallagher I was one of those people 25 years ago who was part of the consensus that we could engage Communist China into the world economy I had an opportunity to travel extensively meeting with the Chinese leadership at that time They were saying the right things I think some of them were sincere It was an encouraging opportunity But over the course of the last 20 years it has taken a wrong turn We have watched the Chinese play a cynical game They have not lived up to their obligations under the WTO We don t have a procurement provision for example We have watched repression increase and we have watched this current regime in unprecedented ways exploit opportunities I have legislation to close the de minimis loophole that allows China to import 2 million packages a day untaxed and uninspected and Heaven only knows in terms of forced labor in terms of illicit goods that are coming in here I have had legislation to try to change that I think this select committee can be a forum to bring us together on a nonpartisan basis to take areas in which there is profound agreement like closing the de minimis loophole I commend the Speaker and the leadership moving forward I look forward to working with Democratic leadership on this to use it as an opportunity to get us back on track particularly given the insidious nature of the current regime s forced labor We have made great progress legislatively to give us more tools I think there is a potential for this select committee to build on it and make more progress and I look forward to working with them I will support the proposal
218	Mr Speaker today I rise in support of the select committee on China As a 23 year veteran of the United States Navy and a former Navy SEAL commander I am acquainted with China and its looming threat Without question China s actions represent a threat not only to national security but also our environment As Secretary of the Interior I led a delegation of officials to the Pacific Islands and witnessed firsthand China s intentions I can tell you their intentions are clear control and dominance in the South China Sea and the hemisphere It should be noted that China has the largest standing Navy greater than the United States They have stolen U S technology and have increased their capacity for nuclear weapons China continues to threaten democracies such as Taiwan the Philippines and even our territories On the environmental front the People s Republic of China is the world s largest emitter of greenhouse gases the largest source of marine debris the worst perpetrator of illegal unreported and unregulated fishing and is the world s largest consumer of trafficked wildlife and timber products In fact 90 percent of the world s plastics found in oceans comes from four rivers in China China s actions today represent a clear and present danger and they use any means available to them blackmail data hacking and espionage It is time to act in a bipartisan way and I strongly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in supporting this critical bill
219	Mr Speaker there is broad recognition among Democrats and Republicans that Congress must adopt a whole of government approach in response to the intensifying great power competition between the United States and China The formation of the select committee is the Republicans response to the China question However I do remain skeptical of the true intentions behind the formation of this committee and I hope my Republican colleagues can approach this topic from a position of strength not weakness xenophobia or fear A specific focus on strategic competition with China could be meaningful if the committee s work remains constructive but I question why the work of this proposed select committee could not have been done through the current committees of jurisdiction With that being said to be constructive the committee should consider perspectives beyond the military domain that include the political economic military cultural and diplomatic implications of a potential U S response Republican leadership should also select Members to sit on this committee who are serious minded about the risks posed by China and not merely anti China hawks yearning to isolate China through military might Most importantly it is my hope that the committee will consider meaningful ways that we can promote a rules based international order that the United States has spent considerable time and resources building up in the post World War II era We must leverage our soft power tools and work cooperatively with our allies and other democratically aligned partners across the globe to achieve our ends Finally unity at home is just as important to demonstrating the strength of our Nation as it is to project our strength abroad Our strength is derived from our unwavering commitment to our democratic values the cohesion of our alliances the intellect and innovation of our people and the shared prosperity of every American What grants us currency with the world is our credibility at home as a reliable partner that provides a robust social safety net for its people and consistently supports democratic ideals Mr Speaker I urge my Republican colleagues to take this opportunity seriously It is not simply enough to demonize and dehumanize our adversaries to align the world behind our democratic ideals Let s use this select committee to show that we have unity and strength to outrival China and that we are good for more than just fearful rhetoric Until this point my Republican colleagues have shown an unwillingness to avoid the vitriol that undermines a constructive approach to China so I plan to vote no on this resolution However I hope we can move forward in a constructive way
220	Mr Speaker I rise to address the growing threat posed to the American people by the influence of the Chinese Communist Party Let us be clear the greatest influence the greatest challenge that we face from an outside source today is from the Chinese Communist Party From intellectual property theft to deceptive trade practices and the acquisition of farmland to the consolidation of the rare earth minerals industry the Chinese Communist Party continues to pose challenges to America as we speak Americans are waking up to the threat From combating global public health threats to defending our networks and equipping Americans to lead in global innovation we must act now to confront the growing threat of the CCP Having served on the China Task Force I was proud to work with my colleagues to address these challenges Together we delivered over 400 commonsense and workable solutions to help address the challenges that we certainly recognize we face today In the wake of the COVID 19 pandemic we worked to shed light on the vulnerabilities of our medical supply chain We worked to strengthen our national security protect our American values and secure our place in international leadership for years to come Now it is time to continue that mission by creating the Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the CCP This select committee will finally give the threats posed by the CCP their due congressional attention and ensure that American innovation and American ingenuity continue to outpace the threats to global security and global stability that is perpetrated by the Chinese Communist Party Mr Speaker I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this resolution
221	Mr Speaker as chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus or CAPAC I rise to address the creation of the Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party CAPAC strongly supports strengthening our economy and national security and we have always recognized that there are legitimate concerns with the actions of the Government of the People s Republic of China This committee could address these issues productively However I rise to remind all Members that this committee should not be used as an open invitation to traffic in blatant xenophobic anti China rhetoric that we know results in physical violence against Asian Americans We certainly saw this with Trump s labeling of COVID as the China virus resulting in 11 500 hate crimes against AAPIs in this country This committee cannot be used to promote policies that result in the racial profiling of Asian Americans but should directly focus on specific concerns related to the Government of the People s Republic of China We know the danger for Asian American communities if the committee devolves into xenophobic rhetoric and scapegoating Back in the 1980s when the economic competition between the U S and Japan reached a boiling point Vincent Chin was out at a bar in Detroit celebrating his upcoming wedding when two laid off autoworkers shouted It is because of you that we lost our jobs These men harassed Vincent chased him and bashed him in his head with a baseball bat beating him until he died Neither of them served a day in jail and only paid a 3 000 fine Instead of attending his wedding Vincent s family attended his funeral This is part of our country s history and what this shows is what we say and how we say it matters We know how dangerous the consequences can be if we don t get this right
222	Mr Speaker I rise today in strong support of H Res 11 Establishing the Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party As a member of the China Task Force in the 116th and 117th Congresses and a member of the House Intelligence Committee this committee is long overdue and I commend Speaker McCarthy for putting this together A clear and dedicated focus on issues surrounding the strategic competition between the United States and China has never been more important I would make three observations One make no mistake about it Mr Speaker China has a plan to replace us and they are working on it every single day in technology national security and in economics The longer we go without addressing those issues the further we fall behind Number two look at the allies that Xi Jinping and the CCP align themselves with Putin in Russia who is a war criminal and Iran You talk about the unbreakable bond they have with Russia as it relates to the Ukraine conflict they would want nothing more than to see the West lose in this conflict Number three I hope this select committee looks at how we can use our economic power in the United States in the trade space working with our like minded allies in the Indo Pacific region Japan South Korea Australia New Zealand Philippines and Indonesia We have been asleep at the wheel when it comes to the economic power we should be using in the region Finally China continues to exploit democratic norms and standards throughout the region engages in economic manipulation of the global marketplace and threatens global peace and security efforts This select committee is more important than ever to ensure the United States does not continue to delay our focus on the true needs of our strategic competition with China I strongly support this select committee and I urge adoption of the resolution
223	Mr Speaker I rise in support of this select committee As an Asian American who represents the only Asian majority district in the continental United States I would never support a committee that I thought would engage in xenophobia or attacks on the Chinese people I am pleased that this committee is not directed against China but is directed against the Chinese Communist Party in the crafting of the language I am pleased that it is going to focus on things that have been a bipartisan concern human rights violations that Representative McGovern has advocated in standing up for the Uyghurs The fact is this country has lost our industrial base For 40 years on a bipartisan basis we have watched as jobs were shipped offshore factories shut down our trade deficits going from 70 billion to almost 400 billion That has hurt the working class It has hurt our ability to be a superpower and it has led to rising tensions with China If we want to deal with Asian hate in this country one of the things we need to do is rebalance our production It is the loss of our jobs that has fueled some of the xenophobia It is the loss of those jobs that fueled the killing that Representative Chu talked about in Michigan with Vincent Chin I believe this committee cannot only stand up for American interests I believe when done well it can help get us to peace and reduce the tensions with China by rebalancing trade by ensuring that China doesn t invade Taiwan and by standing up for human rights I am pleased on a personal basis that Representative Gallagher will be chair of this committee We have had heated debates in the Armed Services Committee We don t agree on many things but I know that he is a marine a patriot and someone who is going to make sure that the committee is focused on the issues
224	Mr Speaker I thank the gentleman for yielding I rise in support of the creation of this bipartisan Select Committee on Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party Like my friend from California said the title is fundamental here This is a policy dispute between our government and the Chinese Communist Party not China not the Chinese people Most Americans have a great affinity for the Chinese people their industriousness and technical talent both in China and as citizens abroad The United States has a long history of partnership with China in the 19th century as a partner in trade during World War II as an ally and our support of their growth over the past five decades Today as a great power and as an ancient civilization China has been perverted by the modern leadership of leader for life Xi and the CCP Sadly this has been manifested by rampant intellectual property theft overburdening developing nations through corrupt credit practices manipulation of the facts in Wuhan punishment of religious thought and the collapse of the rule of law in one of the freest places on the globe in Hong Kong and perhaps most offensively genocide of the Uyghurs and others During the pandemic we have witnessed the severe vulnerability of the world s global supply chain as being far too reliant on China for minerals for pharmaceuticals for medical supplies for almost everything This select committee will work to address the possible strategies to meet and counter Xi s posture I urge all my colleagues to support its creation I wish Chairman Gallagher well in his mission
225	Mr Speaker I thank the gentleman for yielding the time I rise in strong opposition to H Res 11 which would create a select committee on China The only reason why we are creating this select committee on China is because extremist MAGA Republicans in last week s circular firing squad election for Speaker the Speaker had to promise to allow creation of this committee We have watched China rise We know their activities We know what kind of competition they pose to our economy national security intellectual property human rights all of these issues We know where we stand with China and each of those issues are covered by committees of jurisdiction that exist right now Any investigation that is done can be done through the existing committees So why are we creating this committee I fear that it is to create a platform to unleash anti Asian hate and division This committee should not be used as an open invitation to engage and traffic in blatantly xenophobic anti Asian rhetoric that we know historically results in violence against the Asian people in this country That is the reason why I oppose the creation of this select committee
226	Mr Speaker I rise in support of the select committee on China In February of last year President Xi of China and President Putin of Russia issued a joint statement redefining democracy proclaiming A trend has emerged towards redistribution of power in the world We must take this statement seriously Also in February of last year the White House released its annual report on domestic supply chains highlighting the heavy reliance of many U S industries on China For example China provides more than 70 percent of certain pesticides and three Chinese companies account for 96 percent of the world s dry cargo The recent COVID pandemic underlined our dependencies on vital medications like 90 percent of U S antibiotic imports are from China Such heavy dependencies on any country would be a major risk but being dependent on a communist country with expansionist policies is a significant national security risk We must address it
227	Mr Speaker I thank my friend for yielding Mr Speaker it is my hope that this Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and China will be a sober and comprehensive engagement of the very important challenge China poses to American security and prosperity and that of our allies and not a cynical descent into the worst impulses of Republican oversight efforts This select committee offers an opportunity for this body to assess and act on how the United States can compete with the CCP on advanced manufacturing trade and emerging technologies lead the world in competition between democracy versus autocracy and to bring to light the autocratic practices and human rights violations in Hong Kong the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and Tibet As president of NATO s legislative arm I was proud to partner with my colleagues in this body on both sides of the aisle and on both sides of the Atlantic to put China on the NATO agenda for the very first time in its 70 year history I am hopeful this select committee can also follow the lead of the Congressional Taiwan Caucus which I co chair and have co chaired for 10 years to use this committee as a venue to express bipartisan support for Taiwan s democracy independence and territorial sovereignty instead of driving wedges that can only advance the interests of those we seek to expose Using this committee to drive partisan wedges would be a missed opportunity and I am hopeful we will not do that I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to tackle the geopolitical question of our generation and to make this a bipartisan inquiry and effort
228	Mr Speaker we know the activities of the Chinese Communist Party under the leadership of Xi the worst genocide since World War II not just according to the United States multiple administrations of the United States but also according to the U N Hong Kong South China Sea threats to India and threats to Taiwan Xi is telling his country to prepare for war Here at home we have the cornering of critical supply chains and dependencies on China that is being done deliberately as they steal their way to the top through our intellectual property spying on the Federal Reserve flooding our key institutions including academia with money buying up farmland Mr Speaker this is a whole of government whole of society challenge that we have never before faced in American history That is why we need a committee like this That is why we need a committee that spans all of these jurisdictions and we certainly need the leadership of my good friend and colleague Representative Mike Gallagher
229	Mr Speaker I come to the floor today to talk about the economic resource warfare that the CCP has launched against the United States As a former businessowner I can tell you the CCP continues to steal hundreds of billions of dollars in intellectual property from American companies with no consequence Under the current weak administration that has lost credibility on the world stage after the failed Afghan withdrawal they have shown no course of action to combat these issues but there is a plan now Thanks to the American people who elected a Republican majority I am happy to support establishing this select committee to hold the CCP accountable I am committed to putting us back ahead of the malign Chinese aggressions While this resolution is just a start we need to also look at mitigating Chairman Xi s One Belt One Road initiative and increase domestic production to offset our GDP to national debt ratio while unleashing American energy production and strengthening the U S dollar This bill is a commonsense approach that will put America first and stop adversarial reliance on nations that intend to eliminate the U S dollar from being the global currency cut off Western Hemisphere supply chains and advance China s goal of hegemony Let s get this done and put America first
230	Mr Speaker for over three decades post Tiananmen Square massacre Congress was deeply divided not between Republican and Democrat but among the majority here and in the Senate who favored unfettered engagement and trade without serious human rights conditionality Indeed President Clinton delinked human rights in trade on May 26 1994 I went up there and gave a press conference I was joined by a few others saying how serious that was to give up on human rights and allow profits to trump human rights We have seen the brutal nature of the Communist regime especially under Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party s ultimate desire to seek hegemony Over the years I have chaired 76 congressional hearings on China and authored several pieces of legislation including the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act and was the Republican sponsor of Jim McGovern s Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act We now have to make sure those laws are being faithfully implemented Mr Speaker 20 years ago when China became a member of the WTO most Members of Congress and certainly in the business and community on foreign policy establishment bought into what James Mann rightfully called the China fantasy In other words if you just trade more with a dictatorship somehow they will matriculate into a democracy That fantasy has been shown to be demonstrably naive at best The CCP has become more powerful because of the trade and dual use items that have accrued over there that are now being used by their military and by their police I would note parenthetically I chaired two hearings on why China should not be invited into the WTO and no one no one listened The record is clear Mr Speaker As predicted we have become more like them Thankfully that is changing but many in our corporate establishment as we saw with the Olympics were standing right by Beijing and the CCP and Xi Jinping and wouldn t utter a word including Coca Cola and others about the terrible killing of the Uyghurs and the use of forced labor camps We have stood by as the Chinese embassy and the Ministry of State Security have harassed people of Chinese heritage and nationality living lawfully in the United States We have not done all that we can do for the people of Hong Kong Tibet and the Uyghur people in the autonomous region But today thankfully we are turning a page and I applaud our Speaker for pushing hard for this select committee Hopefully it will make a difference
231	Mr Speaker I yield myself the balance of my time Mr Speaker this select committee has the potential to do some substantive work and there is a bipartisan group here in this House that for years has been focused on holding China accountable and upholding a high standard of human rights I don t want to close without acknowledging the incredible leadership of Speaker Pelosi in all of this I traveled with Speaker Pelosi to China a few years back and she insisted that we visit Tibet a place that was blocked off for congressional visits for many years She refused to take no for an answer and we went to Tibet Under her leadership the legislation that I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks was passed the most consequential legislation to hold China accountable passed in this Congress in history The potential that this select committee has really is contingent on making sure that the words that were expressed by Speaker McCarthy and by incoming Chair Gallagher are actually upheld The concern that you hear on our side really is concern that this devolves into something that is about promoting conspiracy theories and that tolerates racist language We say that because we have been through all of this The use of the words that the former President chose to employ resulted in hate crimes against Asian Americans in this country It is unconscionable If this committee goes in that direction I assure you that the Democrats on that committee will push back forcefully We want this committee to be effective In theory this is a committee that we should all get behind and I hope that it is successful I hope that it is bipartisan I hope that it is all that we have been promised here today As I said I am going to vote for this because I think it is the right thing to do and I have faith that our Members on both sides will do the right thing Mr Speaker I urge my colleagues to vote their conscience I am going to vote yes on this and I yield back the balance of my time
232	Mr Speaker I yield myself the balance of my time I begin by thanking my friend for the debate and for his tremendous work in holding China accountable in the human rights area I am certainly confident the Speaker will do as he said and we will have a committee both sides can be proud of Mr Speaker I urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution creating a Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party It is beyond dispute that Communist China poses an urgent generational threat to the United States interests and values America has become far too economically dependent on China in recent decades and as a result our supply chains have become dangerously fragile We must urgently take steps to secure our supply chains and bring them home The Chinese Communist Party continues to push the envelope both in the United States and abroad They steal American intellectual property They build spy networks and propaganda machines on American soil They threaten our allies in Asia and the South China Sea They have spread their influence throughout the developing world seeking to ensnare vulnerable developing countries in debt trap diplomacy Mr Speaker the time has come for the House of Representatives to take a comprehensive look at Communist China We must build on the excellent work done by the China Task Force in 2019 and 2020 We must investigate China s actions and respond appropriately to ensure America confronts this very grave threat Mr Speaker I urge all Members to vote yes on this resolution and I yield back the balance of my time
233	Mr Speaker I rise today in defense of those who defend the unborn I join my esteemed colleague Mike Johnson in calling out against violence Not all of us believe in the Bible but those who do understand that there are over 100 references to a child before it is born For those of us who believe that the child is in existence and recognized by God before they are born wouldn t it be immoral of those people to not stand up for what they believe is life Therefore I call on all those people who respect those beliefs and respect the Bible respect their God that we defend those people in making sure that we don t have violence and we call out as a united body both Democrats and Republicans to protect those who stand for what is right
234	Mr Speaker as the designee of the majority leader pursuant to House Resolution 5 I call up the resolution H Res 12 establishing a Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government as a select investigative subcommittee of the Committee on the Judiciary and ask for its immediate consideration
235	The resolution shall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the majority leader and the minority leader or their respective designees The gentleman from Oklahoma Mr Cole and the gentleman from Massachusetts Mr McGovern each will control 30 minutes The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma Mr Cole general leave
236	Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr Speaker I rise today in support of H Res 12 a resolution establishing the Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government This select subcommittee is modeled on the famous Church Committee which investigated the American intelligence community in the 1970s and uncovered and exposed a wide variety of abuses including many directed against American citizens Similar to the situation that confronted America in the 1970s in recent years we have witnessed abuses of the civil liberties of American citizens committed by the executive branch The select subcommittee will operate as a select investigative subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee and will be tasked with studying and reporting on the executive branch s authority to collect information on or otherwise investigate citizens of the United States It will investigate how executive branch agencies work with and exchange information with the private sector and other government agencies to facilitate action against American citizens how executive branch agencies collect compile analyze use or disseminate information about citizens of the United States the laws programs and activities of the executive branch as they relate to the collection of information on citizens of the United States and any other issues related to the violation of the civil liberties of American citizens Mr Speaker it is undeniable that in recent years the executive branch of the Federal Government has abused its authority and violated the civil liberties of American citizens often for political purposes There are many examples to point to ranging from a father being labeled a domestic terrorist for confronting a school board over the sexual assault of his daughter to the Federal Government s role in suppressing information on Twitter to the Department of Homeland Security s plans to create a Disinformation Governance Board and to the revelations regarding the FBI s abuse of its Foreign Intelligence and Surveillance Act authority All these examples and many more demonstrate how prevalent such abusive actions have become Mr Speaker the American people deserve to have confidence in their government They deserve to know that the broad powers granted through the Federal Government to the FBI to the Department of Homeland Security and to the intelligence agencies are not being abused They deserve to know that the executive branch is not positioning itself as the final arbiter of what constitutes truth They deserve to know that they will not be labeled a domestic terrorist for advocating for their children in front of a school board Mr Speaker it was Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis who stated that sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants At the end of the day that is the purpose of the select subcommittee It will bring abuses by the Federal Government into the light for the American people and ensure that Congress as their elected representatives can take appropriate action to remedy them I have confidence that this select subcommittee will accomplish that goal Mr Speaker I reserve the balance of my time
237	Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr Speaker today we will consider the creation of a new subcommittee here in the House that Republicans call the Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government I call it the McCarthy committee and I am not talking about Kevin I am talking about Joe Mr Speaker this committee is nothing more than a deranged ploy by the MAGA extremists who have hijacked the Republican Party and now want to use taxpayer money to push their far right conspiracy nonsense Let s start with the subcommittee s mandate which is recklessly broad Speaker McCarthy is essentially handing Mr Jordan the power to target anyone and anything he doesn t like anything and anyone he deems unconstitutional illegal or unethical Who decides what is unconstitutional illegal or unethical Mr Jordan does Why don t we just be blunt here Republicans claim to care about law enforcement but this new committee is about attacking law enforcement It is about going after people It is about destroying people s careers and lives It is about undermining the Department of Justice defunding the police and settling scores on behalf of the twice impeached and disgraced former occupant of the Oval Office The MAGA extremist fringe of the Republican Party will use this committee to push QAnon conspiracy theories and lies from Truth Social They are going to use it to gin up fake investigations into nonexistent scandals I think we need to just start calling this the tinfoil hat committee Speaker McCarthy even changed the language at the last minute to provide unprecedented authority for the subcommittee to interfere in ongoing criminal investigations Let me repeat The Republican Party the party that claims to care about law and order has created a committee not just to defund the police based on their wacky conspiracy theories but to actually try to shut down ongoing investigations including into domestic terrorists phony electors insurrectionists people who are on trial for sedition because they tried to overthrow the government and even disgraced former President Donald Trump This is outrageous We are a country of laws but this committee seeks to undermine the law undermine the police and make a complete mockery of the investigative and oversight powers of the House As seen on this week s Sunday shows some sitting Republicans being investigated right now by the FBI and the Department of Justice want to serve on this committee I mean what I mean come on Give me a break I know my Republican friends have some ethically challenged members who asked for pardons from the former President but this is beyond the pale This is unconscionable This is a conflict of interest First they gut the Office of Congressional Ethics Now they give Members of Congress the ability to investigate and to try to shut down criminal investigations that they are subjects in One set of rules for the American people another set of rules for Republican Members of Congress It is incredibly offensive On their first real week in the majority this is what my Republican friends are pushing through Not a bill to fight inflation Not a bill to raise wages for people A bill for Republican Members of Congress to shut down investigations into their own wrongdoings What is wrong with these people On top of all of that this subcommittee expects to use the power of the subpoena to advance their delusional QAnon conspiracy theories and harass Federal law enforcement agents I would say it is almost comical if it wasn t so disturbing that Speaker McCarthy and Mr Jordan refused to comply with bipartisan subpoenas issued by the January 6th Committee So I guess for them it is do as I say not as I do In my mind it speaks volumes that House Republicans are choosing to prioritize this kind of dangerous partisan garbage instead of actually trying to help everyday Americans Whatever happened to Republicans commitment to America They promised to tackle inflation end the opioid crisis reduce the national debt and more None of those issues are addressed in their first 12 bills In fact the very first bill they passed last night doesn t reduce the deficit it adds 114 billion to the deficit by making it easier for billionaires to cheat on their taxes This is where we are week 2 of the 118th Congress and we are creating a witch hunt committee where Republicans plan to air their grievances and further incite crazy fringe conspiracy theories from the internet at the taxpayers expense Senator Joseph McCarthy would be very proud of what Republicans are doing today Putting their own personal power and partisan politics over the needs of the American people Just like Senator McCarthy looking for imaginary communists they are going to find QAnon conspiracies everywhere they look because that is what they want to find Just like the McCarthy committee this will become another shameful disgraceful moment for the Congress of the United States This has nothing to do with the rule of law nothing to do with proper oversight of government It is simply about revenge It is about disrupting and destroying rather than collaborating and creating It is about putting politics over people instead of putting people over politics to build a better future for America This subcommittee is an awful idea and I urge my colleagues in the strongest possible terms to vote no on this monstrosity that will further empower the extremists at the expense of the American people Mr Speaker I reserve the balance of my time
238	Mr Speaker I appreciate the gentleman yielding A ploy It is not a ploy when the Department of Justice treats parents as terrorists moms and dads who are simply showing up at a school board meeting to advocate for their son or daughter It is not a ploy when the FBI pays Twitter 3 million not 1 not 2 3 million to censor American citizens It is not a ploy when the Department of Homeland Security tries to set up a disinformation governance board because we all know that the Department of Homeland Security can tell what is good speech and what is bad speech You have got to be kidding me I will tell you what dozens of whistleblowers who have come and talked to Republican staff on the Judiciary Committee don t think this is a ploy That is why they came to talk to us They know how serious this is The former Democrat chair of the Judiciary Committee is in the press today saying we are going to fight this tooth and nail This is political Meanwhile the former Democrat chair of the Intelligence Committee pressured Twitter to censor a journalist You have got to be kidding me This is about the First Amendment something you guys used to care about I had actually hoped we could get bipartisan agreement on protecting the First Amendment the five rights we enjoy as Americans under the First Amendment Your right to practice your faith your right to assemble your right to petition the government freedom of press freedom of speech Every single one has been attacked in the last 2 years The Government was telling people they couldn t go to church just a few years ago your right to assemble Your right to petition the Government The Democrats kept the Capitol closed You couldn t as a citizen come to your Capitol that you pay for to address your Member of Congress to redress your grievances because Nancy Pelosi wouldn t let you in Freedom of the press I just told you what the head of the Intel Committee tried to do to a journalist The most important right we have though is your right to talk Because if you can t talk you can t practice your faith you can t share your faith you can t petition your government The right to speak is the most important and that is what they are going after That is why we have had dozens of whistleblowers come talk to us We want to focus on that because we want it all to stop We want the double standard to stop This idea that oh if you are a pro life activist you are going to get your door kicked in and you are going to get arrested and handcuffed in front of your seven kids and your spouse for simply praying in front of abortion clinic and telling the guy who was harassing your son to knock it off you are going to have the FBI raid your home but the protests that went on at Supreme Court Justices homes in the aftermath of the leak of the Dobbs opinion oh no problem there Americans are sick and tired of it We don t want to go after anyone We just want it to stop We want to respect the First Amendment to the Constitution that the greatest country in the world has That is what this committee is all about and that is what we are going to focus on That is what we are going to do
239	Mr Speaker I include in the Record an article from The Hill titled January 6 panel names six House GOP lawmakers who asked for pardons From The Hill June 23 2022 Jan 6 Panel Names Six House GOP Lawmakers Who Asked for Pardons By Mychael Schnell and Emily Brooks The Jan 6 committee investigating the attack on the Capitol revealed Thursday that at least a half dozen Republican lawmakers asked for presidential pardons for their role in voting to overturn election results in certain states on Jan 6 2021 according to testimony from former Trump aides Testimony from Trump aides named Reps Matt Gaetz Fla Mo Brooks Ala Louie Gohmert Texas Andy Biggs Ariz and Scott Perry PA as seeking pardons An aide also said that Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene Ga contacted the White House Counsel s office seeking a pardon Rep Adam Kinzinger R Ill a member of the panel who played an elevated role in Thursday s proceedings presented an email from Brooks dated Jan 11 2021 in which the congressman asked for presidential pardons for himself Gaetz and lawmakers who objected to the Electoral College vote for Arizona and Pennsylvania President Trump asked me to send you this letter This letter is also pursuant to a request from Matt Gaetz the email reads As such I recommend that President give general all purpose pardons to the following groups of people the email adds Every Congressman and Senator who voted to reject the electoral vote submission of Arizona and Pennsylvania A spokesman for Brooks forwarded a full copy of the email which included a concern that Democrats would abuse America s judicial system by targeting numerous Republicans with sham charges The email request says it all There was a concern Democrats would abuse the judicial system by prosecuting and jailing Republicans who acted pursuant to their Constitutional or statutory duties under 3 USC 15 Brooks said in a statement Fortunately with time passage more rational forces took over and no one was persecuted for performing their lawful duties which means a pardon was unnecessary after all The panel also showed a video of former special assistant to the president Cassidy Hutchinson saying Gaetz and Brooks both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon for members of Congress involved with a meeting that took place on Dec 21 2020 presumably the huddle at the White House that focused on overturning the 2020 presidential election She also said Gaetz and Brooks advocated for a blanket pardon for a handful of other members that weren t at the Dec 21 meeting Those were meant to be preemptive pardons she noted Additionally Hutchinson said Gaetz was personally pushing for a pardon and he was doing so since early December but said she did not know why Gaetz reached out to Hutchinson asking for a meeting with Meadows about receiving a presidential pardon according to her closed door testimony presented at Thursday s hearing Hutchinson said Biggs Gohmert and Perry also asked for pardons but did not reveal more details And she said Rep Jim Jordan R Ohio a fierce defender of Trump talked about congressional pardons but he never asked me for one noting that he was largely inquiring about whether or not the White House was going to grant the lawmaker pardons Brooks Biggs Perry and Jordan were all issued subpoenas by the select committee in May Perry previously denied that he asked for a pardon and stood by that in light of new testimony I stand by my statement that I never sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress At no time did I speak with Miss Hutchinson a White House scheduler nor any White House staff about a pardon for myself or any other Member of Congress this never happened Perry said in a statement A spokesman for Perry previously denied that he asked for a pardon calling it laughable ludicrous and a thoroughly soulless lie In a statement Thursday night Gohmert said he requested pardons for U S service members and military contractors not himself He called the claim that he requested a pardon for himself malicious despicable and unfit for a U S Congressional hearing I requested pardons for brave U S service members and military contractors who were railroaded by the justice system due to superiors playing politics as well as a civilian leader who was also wronged by a despicable injustice Gohmert said These requests were all far prior to and completely unrelated to January 6 Biggs also objected to the committee s assertion that he sought a parton writing in a statement Thursday night that Hutchinson is mistaken He said the testimony of Hutchinson discussing the pardons was deceptively edited to make it appear as if I personally asked for her a presidential pardon Greene Hutchinson said did not contact her directly but she said she had heard that Greene contacted the White House Counsel s office for a pardon Greene pushed back on the testimony in a tweet but did not directly deny asking for a pardon Saying I heard means you don t know Greene said Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about Eric Herschmann a former Trump White House attorney was also asked by the Jan 6 committee in a deposition if Gaetz was seeking a pardon Believe so Herschmann said in a video presented at the hearing The general tone was we may get prosecuted because we were defensive of you know the President s positions on these things Herschmann said that Gaetz s pardon request was for any and all things and that Gaetz had mentioned former President Richard Nixon s pardon Herschmann said that Nixon s pardon was not that broad Trump adviser John McEntee also testified that Gaetz told him he asked Meadows for a pardon A spokesman for Gaetz responded to testimony about the pardon request by pointing to a tweet from Gaetz calling the committee a political sideshow
240	Mr Speaker I rise in strong opposition to this resolution which appears designed to launch a dangerous and unprecedented attack on our law enforcement agencies Last week Americans across the country watched the Republican Party melt down the moment it encountered its first test For days the extremist wing of the party held the rest of their caucus hostage as they demanded a steep price for their support Today we have the first of their many demands on display an open ended investigation into whatever conspiracy theories may be headlining the rightwing echo chamber at the moment with unchecked authority to undermine ongoing criminal and intelligence investigations For example the select committee can use its expansive authorities to protect Donald Trump those who perpetrated fake elector schemes to overturn the 2020 Presidential election insurrectionists facing trials for their crimes and other domestic terrorists It aims to undermine the safeguards of our democracy and to embolden MAGA extremists who would rather see our institutions fail than to see Democrats and President Biden succeed Make no mistake the destroy democracy subcommittee will enable the House Republicans to interfere with the free operation of businesses they do not like to inhibit the fight against domestic terrorism and to settle political scores on behalf of Donald Trump The Judiciary Committee has serious work to do But rather than trying to solve the problems of the American people this new subcommittee will expend untold time and money undermining our Nation s law enforcement agencies our justice system and our intelligence community all for a political stunt catering to the extremist wing of the Republican Party Mr Speaker I oppose this resolution and I encourage my colleagues to do the same
241	Mr Speaker I rise today in support of the creation of the Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government The Federal Government exists to serve the American people administer the law impartially and protect our cherished freedoms enshrined in the Constitution However some unelected unaccountable Federal bureaucrats have abused their positions of power The other side of the aisle likes to talk about threats to democracy but they refuse to do any congressional oversight as the Federal Government weaponized its authority influence and power to target American groups and citizens based on their political and ideological views Just yesterday we learned that classified documents from Joe Biden s time as Vice President were stashed in an unsecured closet The National Archives knew about these documents several months ago before the election but the American people were just informed yesterday thanks to some investigative reporting Meanwhile the FBI conducted a raid on former President Trump s Mar a Lago residence for the same violation Why has President Biden who has repeatedly kept classified materials in an unsecured location for years never faced a raid Is it because we have a two tier system of justice The left also continues to push for an expanded IRS even though the agency has a history of targeting conservative political groups They have pushed for more audits of middle class Americans instead of better customer service In another example at President Biden s direction the Department of Homeland Security formed a dystopian disinformation board tasked with policing American speech online While this board has been disbanded we continue to learn more almost every day about how the Biden administration pressures big tech to censor and oppress Americans views online that are contrary to their political narrative The Biden administration s Justice Department also actively targeted parents concerned about woke curricula in their children s schools and labeled many as domestic terrorists The American people have made it clear that they want accountability for these abuses
242	Mr Speaker we cannot delay accountability any longer We need to get to work now We must expose the abuses committed by the unelected unaccountable Federal bureaucracy and enact solutions to prevent similar abuses from happening in the future I look forward as chairman of the House Oversight Committee to work closely with this new select committee
243	Mr Speaker I include in the Record a CNN article titled There are clear distinctions between Trump and Biden s two cases From CNN Politics Jan 10 2023 There Are Clear Distinctions Between Trump and Biden s Two Cases By Stephen Collinson Republicans seized on revelations that several classified documents from Joe Biden s time as vice president were found in his former private office to create cover for former President Donald Trump s hoarding of secret records The disclosures Monday about the material found last fall spun up an immediate political storm at a time when Trump is in increasing legal peril The new GOP House majority is meanwhile rushing to undermine investigations against him and unleashing a wave of counter investigations against the current president But there are clear distinctions between the two cases The new controversy so far appears to be on a smaller scale than the more than 100 classified documents some bearing the highest designations of government secrecy taken from Trump s resort at Mar a Lago after a court approved search by FBI agents And Biden appears to be cooperating with the National Archives and the Justice Department in a way that Trump failed to do and unlike the former president he is not being investigated for possible obstruction of justice But Trump who brands attempts to make him face accountability for his conduct in office and afterward as political victimization sought to capitalize on Biden s discomfort over the documents in a post on his Truth Social network When is the FBI going to raid the many homes of Joe Biden perhaps even the White House These documents were definitely not declassified he wrote New House Oversight Chairman James Comer told CNN This is a further concern that there is a two tiered justice system New House Speaker Kevin McCarthy also moved quickly to respond to the discovery of the documents in an office used by Biden after he left the vice presidency Oh really They just now found them after all these years he told CNN What has he said about the other president having classified documents Attorney General Merrick Garland has asked the US attorney in Chicago to review the material some of which bore the marking sensitive compartmentalized information showing that it came from intelligence sources Questions Biden must face Fairness and respect for the law dictate that Biden should answer many of the same questions that Trump is facing regarding whether he was entitled to the records why they were not previously turned over whether they were securely stored and how they ended up in his office in the first place Critics will also wonder why Biden didn t immediately disclose the discovery of less than a dozen documents last fall to the public given the huge sensitivity of the Justice Department probe of Trump on a similar question And the president will be sure to face accusations of hypocrisy given his sharp criticisms that Trump did not take the proper steps to secure classified documents at Mar a Lago Still even if there are adequate answers to these issues any distinctions in the severity of the Biden and Trump documents will be obliterated in the political torrent that is already stirring and with conservative media likely to draw false equivalencies between the two cases The report offers an immediate opening for Trump as he seeks to dodge culpability for his behavior and claims he s a victim of persecution to thwart his 2024 campaign The former president is a master at turning one incident into an entire campaign narrative as he did with former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton s emails in 2016 And the report will give the new Republican House majority fresh material as it unleashes a multi front investigative assault against the White House And while there so far appear to be clear differences in the magnitude of the cases the report first carried by CBS about Biden will inevitably raise political pressure on Special Counsel Jack Smith s investigation into Trump s retention of classified material Smith is also now reaching even deeper into the ex president s inner circle by subpoenaing his former lawyer Rudy Giuliani as part of a federal grand jury probe looking at Trump s fund raising among other issues related to the 2020 election Garland s dilemma The Biden document disclosures will also deepen the already intense political headache facing Garland as he contemplates an eventual decision on whether to charge Trump whose status as an ex president and an active 2024 candidate carries huge political implications Garland insists that investigations will go where the evidence and the law demands as he seeks to stress the independence of the Justice Department which was perpetually in question when Trump was president But now inevitably and however the Biden vice presidential documents issue is resolved a decision to charge Trump over the classified documents case but not to take the same action against Biden would incite political uproar among conservatives who would be sure to allege double standards The former president s legal team issued a temperate response to the Biden report that sought to broaden openings that could shield their client One lawyer said that the Biden story was indicative of a larger problem with trying to keep track of classified information in the offices of the President and the VP There is an over classification problem and at the end of an Administration things get packed up and moved and it s hard to keep track The lawyer also warned that if Trump were to be charged his representatives would demand all communications between the National Archives and Biden s team on the matter The Biden discovery Biden s attorneys found the documents in a locked closet in a private office in Washington the future president used as a visiting professor with the University of Pennsylvania The White House Counsel s office notified the National Archives and officials at the agency took control of the documents the morning after they were found Biden wasn t aware the documents were in the office until his personal lawyers reported their existence and remains in the dark of the content of the material a source familiar with the matter told CNN Federal office holders are required by law to relinquish official documents and classified documents when their government service ends Unlike in Trump s case Biden doesn t appear to have tried to assert ownership of the files to obstruct their handover or make outlandish claims that he had previously declassified them based on an undisclosed private thought Trump is being investigated by Smith to see whether he infringed the Espionage Act by keeping classified material and for the possible obstruction of justice Republicans muster for investigative assault on White House The Biden documents case will intensify the showdown already emerging between the new Republican House majority and the White House For two years Trump has been rocked by blow after blow from congressional and criminal probes over his conduct during and after his presidency that have nudged him ever closer to accountability But help is on the way The new Republican majority in the House is ready to unleash a vast investigative machine apparently designed to discredit and distract from Trump s alleged transgressions and to wound Biden s nascent reelection race Such an offensive was always coming given the extent to which the deeply conservative House GOP remains in thrall to the ex president But the intensity scope and financial muscle of the investigations was bolstered by the concessions offered by McCarthy as he caved to right wing hardliners in order to win his speakership last week And it represents a fast expanding challenge for the White House which has already spent months preparing its defense A new House rules package passed on Monday for instance will set up probes into alleged political bias in agencies like the FBI and the Justice Department and what Republicans see as political weaponization of such agencies The move cements the GOP s sharp turn away from the FBI once seen as one of the most conservative agencies in the US government following Trump s repeated claims he was illegally targeted by investigations and his failure to enlist the bureau as a weapon to advance his political grievances Rigorous scrutiny and oversight are inevitable and desirable as part of the constitutional duty of Congress and responsibility to ensure accountability with taxpayer money And in the first two years of the Biden administration there are multiple questions that merit further investigation and over which the public deserves more clarity This includes the chaotic management of the withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 the way that Covid 19 mitigation funds were spent or the administration s unwillingness at least until recently to consider the rising numbers of migrants crossing the southern border as a crisis Proper oversight can avoid the repeat of errors and inform better policy in future But as always in Congress there are questions over when genuine oversight stops and hyper partisan politically motivated witch hunts begin especially in the case of key Republicans who have a long record of crossing over the line Incoming House Judiciary Chairman Rep Jim Jordan for instance was a leading player in a previous investigation by a GOP House into the death of US ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other Americans who were killed by Islamic militants in Benghazi in 2012 The two year GOP run House probe found a perfect storm of bureaucratic inertia rapidly worsening security in Libya and inadequate resources led up to the killings But Jordan was not satisfied when the final report did not bear out conservative attacks on the conduct of Hillary Clinton who was Secretary of State at the time of the deaths The Ohio lawmaker released his own far more critical report along with then Rep Mike Pompeo who later became Secretary of State himself And at the time McCarthy boasted that the investigation harmed Clinton s 2016 presidential campaign apparently revealing partisan motivations behind the probe As well as the building storm over classified documents a key focus of the new GOP House majority will be to investigate the House Select Committee in the previous Democratic run House that painted a damning picture of Trump s behavior following the 2020 election and before the Capitol insurrection The fact that many of the current members of the House voted to deny certification of Biden s election victory based on lies about electoral fraud Trump was using to try to steal power underscores why many observers are raising new questions about the partisan nature of Republican investigations But after the revelations about documents found in Biden s office Republicans know a political gift when they see it
244	Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr Speaker the difference is clear Unlike in Trump s case Biden doesn t appear to have tried to assert ownership of the files to obstruct their handover or make unhinged claims that he had previously declassified them through his thinking Trump is being investigated to see whether he infringed the Espionage Act by keeping classified material and for the possible obstruction of justice I would just say to my colleague who spoke before the American people also have expectations of elected officials such as respecting the Constitution and respecting free and fair elections and not trying to overturn free and fair elections Unfortunately a majority of my friends on the other side of the aisle chose to ignore that Mr Speaker I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York Mr Goldman
245	Mr Speaker I rise today to make something crystal clear The primary purpose of this special subcommittee is to interfere with the special counsel s ongoing investigation into a conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election This is a shocking abuse of power but it is not just the usual efforts by Members on the other side of the aisle to once again do Donald Trump s dirty work This time they are trying to protect themselves One of them a Member from Pennsylvania had his cell phone seized pursuant to a court order finding probable cause that he committed a crime Yet he has indicated that he wants to be on this subcommittee so that he can undermine a criminal investigation into himself My Republican counterparts can dress up the subcommittee with a menacing name but let s call it what it really is the Republican committee to obstruct justice The American people don t want that They don t want yet another front of the Republican war on democracy and the rule of law Mr Speaker I will vote no and urge everyone to do so
246	Mr Speaker last Congress I served as the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee Chairman Jordan and I have already been working to ensure that the intelligence community and the Department of Justice including the FBI are not violating the civil rights of law abiding Americans Sadly we already have very troubling evidence to begin our investigation to ensure that our intelligence community and law enforcement agencies are not violating Americans constitutional rights Some of this information is similar to what has been publicly disclosed by the Twitter files which is a small portion of the information that we have that is gravely concerning about the improper use of government authority that this committee will be focusing on This subcommittee is about protecting rights a task that everyone in this body just took an oath to protect last week Our committee will be assisting this subcommittee We look forward to working with Chairman Jordan on this important issue and we know that this is important to the American people
247	Mr Speaker I include in the Record an article from The Guardian titled It s going to be dirty Republicans gear up for attack on Hunter Biden and an article from Politico titled It s not just Hunter Biden Prepare for a 2023 packed with House GOP investigations From the Guardian Jan 8 2023 It s Going To Be Dirty Republicans Gear Up for Attack on Hunter Biden By David Smith When Borat alias British actor Sacha Baron Cohen told risque jokes about Donald Trump and antisemitism at last month s Kennedy Center Honors in Washington Joe Biden was not the only one laughing in a red velvet lined balcony Sitting behind the US president was Hunter Biden wearing black tie and broad smile that mirrored those of his father The image captured the intimacy between the men but also the sometimes awkward status of Hunter as both private citizen and privileged son of a president It is a dichotomy likely to come under a harsh public glare this year as congressional Republicans set about making Hunter a household name and staple of the news cycle The right wing is licking its chops at the chance to go after him said Joshua Kendall author of First Dads Parenting and Politics from George Washington to Barack Obama The level of venom is going to be over the top and really really dirty The Republicans rhetoric might get so heated that it detracts from some of the actual behaviour Republicans have been waiting a long time for this moment After regaining control of the House of Representatives in last November s midterm elections they used their first press conference to promise to investigate the Biden administration and in particular the president s allegedly errant son Hunter has long faced questions about whether he traded on his father s political career for profit including efforts to strike deals in China and reported references in his emails to the big guy Hunter joined the board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma in 2014 around the time that Joe Biden then vice president was helping conduct Barack Obama s foreign policy with Ukraine Hunter earned more than 50 000 a month over a five year period Senate Republicans claim that his appointment may have posed a conflict of interest Last year more than 30 of them called for a prosecutor to be given special counsel authority to carry out an investigation into alleged tax fraud money laundering and foreign lobbying violations But they have not produced evidence that it influenced US policy or that Joe Biden engaged in wrongdoing House Republicans and their staff have been studying messages and financial transactions found on a now notorious laptop that belonged to Hunter Having gained the majority they now have the power to issue congressional subpoenas to foreign entities that did business with him Richard Painter who was chief White House ethics lawyer in the George W Bush administration believes that Joe Biden should have recused himself from matters relating to Ukraine The Ukrainian gas company wanted to curry favour with Joe Biden so they put his son on the board he said It s pretty clear what s going on there but the missing link the Republicans are looking for but I don t think they re going to find is any kind of a quid pro quo Joe Biden for the Ukrainian gas company Still it would have been better if Joe Biden had said Look my son is going to be on this board maybe the secretary of state or somebody else could handle Ukraine and he d step aside Hunter s taxes and foreign business work are already under federal investigation with a grand jury in Delaware hearing testimony in recent months There are no indications that this involves the president who insists that he has never spoken to Hunter about his foreign business arrangements Republicans are pulling at another strand Ethics experts have accused Hunter of cashing in on his father s name as he pursues a career as an artist He is represented by the Georges Berges Gallery in New York which reportedly struck an agreement with the White House to set the prices of the art and not reveal who bid on or bought it Berges said in an lnstagram post in November that Republicans on the House oversight committee had written to him with certain requests and subsequently got into a Twitter debate with Painter about money and influence in art Berges wrote If you re going to scrutinize a profession then scrutinize all of them and every position that children of Congress take in DC and elsewhere Painter said in an interview I don t think there s anything corrupt about the White House or anything corrupt about President Biden But keeping the identities of the art buyers secret was a bad idea It leads to suspicion that people are passing money under the table It s hard to keep who buys the art secret in the close knit world of Hunter Biden s friends or Hunter Biden himself so the secrecy was a bad idea Fox News and other rightwing media may relish an opportunity to demonise the president s son ahead of an election in 2024 But Republicans are in danger of overreach Trump s attempt to get Ukraine to examine Hunter s business dealings led to his first impeachment His efforts to weaponise Hunter s troubles in the 2020 presidential election fizzled David Brock a veteran political operative and president of Facts First USA a new group set up to combat the congressional investigations said What we re going to see in the hearings is a recycling and a rehash of old discredited stories and conspiracy theories They re doing it for political reasons Congressman Jim Jordan is on the record saying that the investigations are all about 2024 and electing Donald Trump again That s his own words not mine Hunter s 2021 memoir Beautiful Things generated sympathy in some quarters for a man who 50 years ago last month survived a car crash that killed his mother and sister and who has been honest about his struggle with alcoholism and drug abuse Brock believes that a fresh Republican onslaught will backfire Going after someone who has an addiction and has had mental health issues is sadistic politics and I don t think it will work with the American people he added There are so many people who have family members who ve suffered in one way or another and will identify with Hunter they won t identify with the attackers The Hunter hating narrative has been out there for three years It hasn t really gained any traction outside of the far right and I don t think it will Republicans could also lose credibility by focusing on Hunter and other retreads of the past instead of advancing a plan for domestic issues such as inflation jobs and taxes Kurt Bardella a Democratic strategist who served as a senior adviser for Republicans on the House oversight committee from 2009 to 2013 said For all the talk about Republicans saying they want to return to regular order they want to have better stewardship over taxpayer dollars they want to act more responsibly with legislative power well OK but how does investigating Hunter Biden do anything to help the American people
248	Mr Speaker without a doubt Mr Jordan will use this subcommittee to go after people MAGA extremists see as their opponents All the MAGA Republicans seem to want to do is create a forum for settling scores and pushing conspiracy theories They are not interested in governing They want to go on FOX They want to investigate Hunter Biden s laptop They want to try to steal elections They want to shut down the government if they don t get their way We are at a very dangerous moment in this country and it is one of the reasons why many of us were so stunned that the new Speaker gave away so much of his authority to a group of extremists in the Republican Conference who have spent their entire careers trying to blow this place up The bottom line is this committee is basically an assurance that we are going to see these very partisan political MAGA driven investigations go forward Mr Speaker I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote no Mr Speaker I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona Mr Grijalva
249	Mr Speaker I thank the gentleman for the time As Ranking Member Nadler from the Judiciary Committee said H Res 12 is a dangerous government attempt to interject extremist politics into our justice system and shield MAGA extremists from legal consequences for their actions including January 6 and the follow up and investigations that are ongoing now He is right about that Republican strategy H Res 12 is both political cover and a political weapon Like any legislation H Res 12 is driven by the motivation of its sponsors the Republican majority in the House of Representatives For example legislative action on climate change is motivated by urgency and our collective health and life but H Res 12 is intended to intimidate scare and ultimately cower our public institutions into standing down as our descent into division and fascism continues Power for the sake of power is truly dangerous H Res 12 is just that Mr Speaker I urge a no vote
250	Mr Speaker I rise today in support of a select committee to investigate the weaponization of the Federal Government something I have a lot of experience with firsthand I proudly served as the 52nd Secretary of the Interior Despite the deep state s repeated attempts to stop me I stand before you as a duly elected Member of the United States Congress and tell you that a deep state exists and is perhaps the strongest covert weapon the left has against the American people There is no doubt the Federal Government deep state coordinates with liberal activists and uses politicians and willing media to carry their water The deep state runs secret messaging campaigns with one goal in mind to increase its power to censor and persuade the American people Dark money groups funded by liberal billionaires and foreign investors funnel money to shell organizations and repeatedly attempt to destroy the American West In many cases they want to wipe out the American cowboy completely remove public access to our lands and turn Montana into a national park They want to control our land and our lifestyle Mr Speaker I include in the Record two parts of a five part series of investigative articles by the Capital Research Center titled Arabella s Long War Web of Pop Up Groups and Arabella s Long War Keep it in the Ground From the Capital Research Center Nov 12 2021 Arabella s Long War Web of Pop Up Groups How Leftist Dark Money Activists Brought Down Trump s Secretary of the Interior and Paved the way for Biden s Radical Environmentalists By Hayden Ludmig A Web of Pop Up Groups Enter Arabella Advisors a consulting firm based in Washington DC that quietly runs arguably the most powerful activist and lobbying network in politics Arabella manages four in house nonprofits collectively called the sisters each of which controls a small army of activists and a legion of pop up groups And each pop up group is made to look like a slick stand alone website These pop ups target virtually every issue in politics control of the courts abortion access gun control and voter registration and mobilization even the Trump Russia collusion hoax pushing left wing policies in every corner What makes Arabella so powerful is how these pop ups deceive individuals into believing they represent genuine local grassroots interests such as one pop up in Alaska created to oppose creation of the Pebble Mine run from Arabella s plush offices in DC Arabella s network is extraordinarily well funded In 2019 alone the four sisters reported total revenues exceeding 730 million and poured out 648 million Between the network s creation in 2006 and its Form 990 filing for 2019 the latest available Arabella s empire has received more than 3 billion and spent nearly 2 5 billion Most of that funding was directed to the network s flagship 501 c 3 nonprofit the New Venture Fund whose largest known donors include the Gates Ford Hewlett Packard and Buffett Foundations Beginning in 2017 Arabella turned its guns on Trump s Department of the Interior using a pop up pair Western Values Project WVP and its sister Western Values Project Action WVPA According to their websites WVP and WVPA were created in 2013 in Helena Montana to expose corrupt corporate lobbyists preying on public lands in the West In reality WVP is run by the 501 c 3 New Venture Fund while WVPA is run by the 501 c 4 Sixteen Thirty Fund Arabella s in house lobbying shop Whatever staff the groups actually have would have been paid by one of Arabella s nonprofits or possibly by Arabella Advisors itself we ll likely never know But in its 2018 Form 990 New Venture Fund revealed that it is the paymaster for Sixteen Thirty Fund which reported zero employees on its own 2018 Form 990 and pays the salary and immediately invoices Sixteen Thirty Fund which reimburses the full amount It s common for groups to use both kinds of nonprofit to maximize their ability to lobby through the 501 c 4 and raise non lobbying funds through the 501 c 3 since donors may deduct donations to the 501 c 3 from their taxes But Arabella takes that tactic to another level using pop up fronts for its nonprofits that can take advantage of the New Venture and Sixteen Thirty Fund s respective tax advantages without disclosing their relationship to one another Donations to WVP and WVPA in fact benefitted the Arabella run nonprofits behind the projects as an archived version of WVP s website from October 2019 reveals Until late 2019 the website for WVP and WVPA revealed a handful of staffers including Chris Saeger ex communications director for the Montana Democratic Party and former Service Employees International Union SEIU staffer Jayson O Neill a Democratic staffer for Montana s legislature and Gov Brian Schweitzer D and Yetta Stein a staffer for the left wing political action committee End Citizens United and staffer for the 2018 reelection campaign Sen Jon Tester D MT The archived website also showed a small advisory board consisting of Kjersten Forseth a former chief of state for Colorado State Senate Democrats former director of the left wing strategy group ProgressNow Colorado political director for the Colorado AFL CIO and chief political strategist for Rocky Mountain Voter Outreach a Denver based get out the vote and ballot initiative firm Kent Salazar an environmental health manager for Albuquerque New Mexico former New Mexico State game commissioner for Gov Bill Richardson D and a board member for the left wing National Wildlife Federation Pat Smith a lawyer representing Indian tribes in Montana member of the 2010 Montana Redistricting Commission and appointee of Montana Gov Steve Bullock D to the Northwest Power and Conservation Council WVP s advisory board also included Caroline Ciccone who in 2019 was executive director of the New Venture Fund pop up and anti Trump oversight group Restore Public Trust Ciccone is a former communications director for the Democratic National Committee DNC Obama appointee to the U S Small Business Administration and Democratic strategist From 2014 to 2017 she led Americans United for Change AUFC a top left wing strategy group whose national field director Scott Foval was recorded in late 2016 by undercover journalists from Project Veritas bragging that AUFC had paid mentally ill and homeless people to instigate violence at Trump campaign rallies We know that Trump s people will tend to freak the f out Foval said in the video It is not hard to get some of these a to pop off The scandal ultimately led back to Robert Creamer co founder of the powerful consulting firm Democracy Partners and a former general consultant to AUFC who directed parts of a vast network of advocacy groups all aligned in support of Hillary Clinton s presidential bid This led to speculation that his firm helped Clinton s campaign violate collusion laws Foval described Creamer s role in the scandal as the kingpin who is diabolical and I love him for it Within days of the video s release Creamer resigned and Foval was fired Also present was Kyle Herrig a New Venture Fund board member who sat on the advisory boards of at least five New Venture Fund projects including American Oversight a judicial activist and litigation group Allied Progress which attacked Trump cabinet officials and the Ciccone run Restore Public Trust In early 2020 it was announced that Western Values Project and these three Arabella pop ups were being rolled into a new organization Accountable US itself a former New Venture Fund project fully established as an independent nonprofit sometime later that year headed by president Kyle Herrig and executive director Caroline Ciccone It appears that Western Values Project Action remains a project of Sixteen Thirty Fund but that remains unclear as of writing This reveals that Western Values Project far from being a grassroots group is enmeshed in a deeply networked highly coordinated cabal of professional activists and it always was
251	We all knew politics was ugly but we need to investigate and uncover corruption no matter where it lies It is time to bring light to the shadows of the deep state and do our duty Mr Speaker I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this critical piece of oversight investigations
252	Mr Speaker here is a curious thing The legislation that creates this select committee we were first given this on January 2 Then it changed on January 6 and we didn t get that until 10 p m on January 6 after 13 Speaker votes What changed in this legislation and this is really curious is they expanded the select committee s authority to investigate ongoing criminal investigations think about that in an unprecedented way I don t know how many votes that got but clearly it was important enough because we went through 13 Speaker votes before we got to this The reason why this is included and I am sad to say this is because we have Members in this Chamber who themselves may be subjects of investigation There are ongoing investigations against the former President So this was added Why was this added To try to frustrate those investigations When we talk about corruption when we talk about undermining the rule of law let s understand what just occurred here Mr Speaker I yield 2 1 2 minutes to the gentleman from California Mr Schiff
253	Mr Speaker I rise in strong opposition to the Republican select subcommittee to investigate deep state conspiracy theories If you had any doubt about what this committee is really about about its true focus my colleague from Montana just confirmed this is all about deep state nonsense Republicans claim without merit that this subcommittee will investigate the so called weaponization of the Federal Government What it is really intended to do is to undermine the legitimate investigation of President Trump s incitement of a violent attack on this building on this Capitol on this citadel of democracy an investigation that implicates some of the very Members of this body who want to sit on that committee Make no mistake this investigation this investigate the investigators committee will do deep damage to our national security and only breed distrust with our national security professionals who will be reluctant to share with Congress the information policymakers need to protect our country The committee will also seek to discredit law enforcement like the FBI who are so important in the fight against domestic violent extremism Republicans in Congress just don t care The greatest terrorist threat to our country comes from violent rightwing militia groups and their sympathizers and Republicans in Congress just don t care The last time Republicans were in charge of the House Kevin McCarthy pushed to form another bogus select committee that one on Benghazi He did so as he admitted to tear down Hillary Clinton s numbers a patently political exercise Now McCarthy is at it again pushed into forming this bogus subcommittee by the QAnon members of his own Conference He sacrificed a lot in his bid for Speaker That was his choice Now the American people are going to pay the price in the form of a body blow to our national security Vote no on this ill considered measure This is no Church Committee not a bipartisan effort to reform government but a partisan effort to tear it down damn the consequences Vote no
254	Mr Speaker in response to the blue anon rhetoric I rise in favor of H Res 12 to establish a subcommittee on the weaponization of the Federal Government The authoritarian left has used the full might and authority of the Federal Government to force its agenda on the American people The Federal Government has been weaponized to pressure private companies to censor conservatives target parents as domestic terrorists simply for caring about their children and their education manipulate the American people by declaring Hunter Biden s laptop as Russian disinformation even failing to inform American citizens about classified documents that a former Vice President had in his possession and launch an unwarranted investigation into President Trump s Presidential campaign Mr Speaker our Constitution is a contract with the American people and our government That contract is designed to produce maximum freedom and minimum tyranny for this great country
255	I thank the gentleman for yielding Mr Speaker I rise in strong opposition to H Res 12 the insurrection protection committee which Speaker McCarthy the 21st century McCarthyism had to agree to last week in order to gain the Speakership MAGA extremist Republicans forced as a consequence of getting their vote the Speaker to promise to create this select committee Donald Trump had his hands in it Donald Trump had his hands in it last week During this circular firing squad he was calling the shots and this will benefit him This insurrection protection committee is set up to insulate the ex President along with various MAGA Republicans who are still serving here in the House and who are under investigation It is here to protect them from that investigation It is here to disrupt the flow of justice in this country This is a dangerous extreme committee that is put in the hands of a group of people who even defied congressional subpoenas and refused to come to testify before the January 6th Committee Now they are trying to interfere with the Justice Department deliberations on whether or not they should be accused and charged with committing criminal offenses in the lead up to on January 6 and thereafter This is a very dangerous piece of legislation MAGA Republicans are behind it led by the head election denier in this country who by the way instituted something down in Brazil this weekend It is a worldwide affair This is dangerous We must stop it Vote no on H Res 12
256	Mr Speaker with great power comes great responsibility We entrust our Department of Justice FBI and intelligence community with great power to keep us safe And yet as long as these agencies have existed they have violated everyday Americans civil rights The security state believes itself to be above the Constitution and the laws passed by Congress or perhaps the belief is only tacit It is aware only of power not authority power The FBI spied on Frank Sinatra John Lennon Dr Martin Luther King Jr and Muhammad Ali because they were national security threats celebrities but everyday Americans as to their constitutional rights The intelligence community abused their power to spy on Presidential candidates a sitting President and Members of Congress and their staffs The FBI continuously coordinated with social media companies to moderate social content the public square So contemptuous and out of touch are they that when confronted with this just weeks ago they said We were merely engaging with our community partners Leading up to the 2020 election the FBI worked hand in hand with Twitter and Facebook to silence the Hunter Biden laptop story Concealment from everyday Americans They have continued to censor in silence criticism of COVID policies and vaccine mandates to the harm of everyday Americans In 2013 the former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper lied to Congress about the NSA collecting data on millions of Americans Yet he has escaped a reckoning The NSA spied on groups including Human Rights Watch Amnesty International and other NGOs FBI contractors conducted thousands of searches on NSA databases The intelligence community spied on journalists and political opponents in clear violation of the First Amendment
257	That is not just all illegal it is un American and it cannot continue The government s massive surveillance apparatus is well documented but there is still much more that we do not know We owe it to the American people to reveal the rot within our Federal Government and cut it out so that it can no longer harm everyday Americans Mr Speaker today we are putting the deep state on notice We are coming for you on behalf of everyday Americans
258	Mr Speaker I remember after 9 11 when we all worked together to ensure the protection of the American people through the Patriot Act and dealing with the FISA courts we worked together because truth is important I just want to simply be on the floor today to speak about truth I work with school boards across my district I know that there is not one school board that does not welcome a parent to hear their voices because obviously they are partners in the education of our precious children In September 2021 the National School Board Association sent Mr Biden a letter pointing to a trend of violence and threats against school officials It included a brief reference to Mr Smith s arrest incident and a long list of examples with a footnote to a news account that mentioned the arrest in passing but without details like his daughter s assault The point is that this came about because there were threats against school board members So can we have truth here That is what I rise to bring to the attention of this body as relates to this committee and this select committee Is there going to be truth finding Is this going to be a committee that is going to collect information or otherwise investigate citizens of the United States and give the most right wing Members who may have an ax to grind the ability to participate or is it going to be fair Is it going to be a gross misuse of power with dangerous implications unintended consequences and potentially expose general operations of our national security infrastructure which will put American lives at risk Let me be very clear Russia is one of our most dangerous adversaries We are in the middle of a national quagmire and to undermine that through investigations of the FBI and Central Intelligence is going to be extremely dangerous
259	Mr Speaker the passage of this resolution would also give MAGA Republicans the ability to interfere in ongoing criminal investigations including those investigating that day that some declared was just a bunch of tourists on January 6 2021 Mr Speaker I have worked with my friends on the other side of the aisle I have worked with Mr Roy But is this a question of truth That is the issue that we stand here discussing today In this country no one is above the law and to suggest that some people should be because they don t agree with the force of law being applied to their activities is contrary to the very fabric of fairness justice and equality that America was founded on Let me as an aside indicate that we know what has been in the headlines 10 documents found in a locked closet that Mr Biden may have had Well you know what Mr Speaker the process of the law is proceeding The call was made The documents were surrendered if you will The process goes forward under the laws of this land No one denied it No one rejected it No one did not in any way come to say anything other than Follow the law On the other hand in Mar a Lago no law was found Mr Speaker I ask my colleagues to consider the truth and vote against this resolution Mr Speaker I rise today in strong opposition to H Res 12 a dangerous resolution whose passage would Establish a Select Committee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government or more accurately a subcommittee that would threaten our nations safety security and freedom MAGA Republicans love to hide behind the idea that they are pushing an agenda that would help the American people but let s see this for what it truly is a blatant assault on our democracy our law enforcement agencies our justice system and our intelligence community and an attempt to shield the twice impeached former president from ongoing investigations being conducted by the Department of Justice The establishment of this subcommittee would give Republicans the ability to investigate any agency that can collect information or otherwise investigate citizens of the United States and gives the most right wing members of the Republican party access to confidential documents solely intended for the members of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence This gross misuse of power will have dangerous implications and unintended consequences and could potentially expose general operations of our national security infrastructure which will put American lives at risk The passage of this resolution would also give MAGA Republicans the ability to interfere in ongoing criminal investigations including those investigating the extremist insurrectionists who lead the brutal attack on this institution two years ago In this country no one is above the law and to suggest that some people should be because they don t agree with the force of the law being applied to their activities is contrary to the very fabric of fairness justice and equality that America was founded on This is a blatant attempt by House GOP members to stifle the federal government s investigatory powers claiming that conservatives are being prosecuted and silenced The new Select Subcommittee comes as federal agencies such as the Department of Justice are investigating the GOP and its allies in multiple criminal investigations Members of the Republican party have been on press tours announcing this new subcommittee and have laid out their agenda but how would this subcommittee help the American people in any way For a party that claims to be pro law enforcement the Republican party is now getting ready to undermine the hard work of our law enforcement and surveillance agencies Mr Speaker what really is the intent here I can tell you what I think it is It is a back door effort to handcuff the current administration in their normal and usual course of operations Mr Speaker I urge all my colleagues to oppose this dangerous and a completely irresponsible Resolution that will put the lives of Americans at risk and is a political stunt to further advance their dangerous conspiracy theories Mr Speaker I include in the Record an article from The New York Times titled Republicans Preparing Broad Inquiry Into F B I and Security Agencies From the New York Times Jan 8 2023 House Republicans Preparing Broad Inquiry Into F B I and Security Agencies By Charlie Savage and Luke Broadwater Newly empowered House Republicans are preparing a wide ranging investigation into law enforcement and national security agencies raising the prospect of politically charged fights with the Eiden administration over access to sensitive information like highly classified intelligence and the details of continuing criminal inquiries by the Justice Department The House plans to vote this week on a resolution to create a special Judiciary subcommittee on what it calls the weaponization of the federal government a topic that Republicans have signaled could include reviewing investigations into former President Donald J Trump The panel would be overseen by Representative Jim Jordan Republican of Ohio who is also poised to become the Judiciary Committee s chairman It remains to be seen who else Speaker Kevin McCarthy who made numerous concessions to a far right faction of his party to win the speakership will put on it In a Fox News interview on Friday evening Representative Chip Roy of Texas a lead negotiator for hard right lawmakers who pushed Mr McCarthy s team for concessions portrayed the panel as part of the agreement they struck for their support He said Mr McCarthy had committed to giving the subcommittee at least as much funding and staffing as the House special committee in the last Congress that investigated the Jan 6 2021 attack on the Capitol So we got more resources more specificity more power to go after this recalcitrant Eiden administration Mr Roy said That s really important A spokesman for Mr Jordan did not reply to a request for comment but both he and Mr McCarthy have spoken for months about their desire for such an investigation and pledged to voters during the 2022 campaign to carry one out We will hold the swamp accountable from the withdrawal of Afghanistan to the origins of Covid and to the weaponization of the F B I Mr McCarthy said in his first remarks as speaker early Saturday Let me be very clear We will use the power of the purse and the power of the subpoena to get the job done The text of the resolution establishing the subcommittee would give the panel essentially open ended jurisdiction to scrutinize any issue related to civil liberties or to examine how any agency of the federal government has collected analyzed and used information about Americans including ongoing criminal investigations The Justice Department has traditionally resisted making information about open criminal investigations available to Congress suggesting that legal and political fights over subpoenas and executive privilege are most likely looming Republicans are promoting Mr Jordan s panel as a new Church Committee referring to a 1970s investigation by Senator Frank Church Democrat of Idaho that uncovered decades of intelligence and civil liberties abuses by presidents of both parties But in an environment in which Mr Trump has been the subject of multiple criminal investigations for years including continuing inquiries into his attempts to overturn the 2020 election results and his hoarding of sensitive documents Democrats predicted the new investigative subcommittee was likely to adopt a more partisan edge Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee said the Church Committee had been a serious and bipartisan attempt to reform the conduct of the intelligence community based on hard and verifiable evidence By contrast he said that this new thing fueled by conspiracy theories and slated to be run by the most extreme members of the MAGA caucus was likely to be more similar to the notorious House Un American Activities Committee of the mid 20th century Mr Jordan is a staunch ally of Mr Trump Late last year as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee when his party was still in the minority he oversaw a 1 000 page staff report that claimed that the F B I had spied on President Trump s campaign and ridiculed conservative Americans and that the rot within the F B I festers in and proceeds from Washington The resolution appears to give him authority to subpoena the Justice Department for information about the special counsel inquiry into Mr Trump s attempts to overturn the 2020 election and his handling of classified documents along with other politically charged matters like an open tax investigation into President Biden s son Hunter Biden The text of the resolution would also grant Mr Jordan s panel the power to receive the same highly classified information that intelligence agencies make available to their oversight committee the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Intelligence Committee members have access to some of the most sensitive secrets in the government including information about covert actions which are not shared with other lawmakers Traditionally House leaders tend to place on the intelligence panel members of their party they think are especially trustworthy not to disclose classified information While Mr Jordan s investigative unit will be housed within the Judiciary Committee its 13 members eight of whom would be Republicans will not be limited to lawmakers on that panel It is not clear for example whether Republican leaders would select hard right members such as Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene the Georgia Republican who was stripped of her committee assignments in 2021 for making a series of violent and conspiratorial social media posts before she was elected Mr McCarthy has already promised her a spot on the House Oversight Committee and she broke with other far right members to support his speakership bid from the first ballot as did Mr Jordan Such a situation could result in lawmakers trying to scrutinize a Justice Department investigation as that inquiry potentially examines some of those same lawmakers conduct concerning the events of Jan 6 In an interview on ABC s This Week on Sunday Representative Scott Perry Republican of Pennsylvania rejected a suggestion that he should pledge not to serve on Mr Jordan s subcommittee because it may scrutinize the Jan 6 investigation and as a witness in that inquiry he had a conflict of interest Mr Perry who played an important role in Mr Trump s attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election had his cellphone seized by the F B I Why should I be limited why should anybody be limited just because someone has made an accusation Mr Perry said adding I get accused of all kinds of things every single day as does every member that serves in the public eye But that doesn t stop you from doing your job It is our duty and it is my duty Some Republicans also seem to see the panel as an opportunity to raise culture war issues and promote conspiracy theories In his interview with Fox Mr Roy described the subcommittee s mission as going after the weaponization of the government the F B I the intel agencies D H S all of them that have been you know labeling Scott Smith a domestic terrorist In fact no agency labeled Mr Smith a domestic terrorist Mr Smith whose daughter was sexually assaulted in a high school bathroom in Virginia was arrested after he lunged at someone at a school board meeting during a tense and chaotic debate over bathroom policy for transgender students He was convicted of disorderly conduct In September 2021 the National School Boards Association sent Mr Biden a letter pointing to a trend of violence and threats against school officials It included a brief reference to Mr Smith s arrest incident amid a long list of examples with a footnote to a news account of the meeting that mentioned the arrest in passing but without details like his daughter s assault The letter also said acts of violence and threats against school officials could be classified as equivalent to a form of domestic terrorism and hate crimes and asked for federal help A few days later Attorney General Merrick B Garland issued a memorandum directing U S attorneys and the F B I to convene meetings across the country with local officials to discuss strategies for addressing threats against school officials and teachers His memo did not call anyone a domestic terrorist and it specifically distinguished spirited debate which it stressed was constitutionally protected from acts of violence and threats But voices on the right have made Mr Smith a cause celebre falsely telling their viewers and readers that the Biden era Justice Department and the F B I consider parents who disagree with liberal school board policies to be domestic terrorists The subcommittee investigation proposed by Mr Jordan is just one of a number of inquiries House Republicans plan to approve this week Included in a separate rules package scheduled to come up for a vote on Monday is a wide ranging inquiry into the coronavirus pandemic including the origins of the virus so called gain of function research the production of vaccines and the conduct of Dr Anthony S Fauci Mr Biden s former chief medical adviser whom Republicans have pledged to haul before them for questioning Republicans are also planning to form a special committee to investigate the Chinese government s economic technological and security progress and its competition with the United States Both the China investigation and the investigation into law enforcement are scheduled for a vote on Tuesday
260	Mr Speaker I listened with interest to my colleague from Texas as she recounted some of the realities when talking about school boards Well I have come to know Scott Smith of Loudoun County I consider him a friend I have been talking to him since the actions against his family in response to his daring to go to the school board to question the abuse of his daughter resulted in his name being put out as the poster child for the weaponization of government against parents who dare question school boards And yes in fact the National School Board Association sent a letter But what became increasingly clear is that it was in collusion with the White House seeking the letter That has become readily clear from the emails that we have gotten through Freedom of Information Act requests that the Biden White House was seeking the National School Board Association to have that kind of a letter request in order that they the Biden administration be able to target Scott Smith and other parents around this country Every American should shudder at the power of the government the Federal Government being targeted at parents for daring to stand up and defend a daughter who was abused in a bathroom in the Loudoun County Public Schools By the way the superintendent in Loudoun County has been indicted This is the truth Yet this administration wanted to make Scott Smith the bad guy not the rapist not the school board that allowed this to occur in the schools in Loudoun County It is not just parents What about Bunni Pounds in the Christians Engaged organization The IRS was targeting their nonprofit status because they happened to be religious This is the power of the IRS How about the power of our public health elite who made decisions and put out misinformation that undermined the ability of Americans to stand up and to continue their jobs and continue to go to school Instead they were masked and had needles put in their arms
261	Mr Speaker I would simply say in response to that that there are oversight committees that are equipped and ready to look into all the issues that the gentleman just raised and into all the conspiracy theories that they want to raise But they went ahead and created this additional committee and there is a reason for it This new committee they are creating has the authority to basically investigate ongoing criminal investigations It is unprecedented In any event I would remind the gentleman you have oversight committees You are in charge now you can do whatever you want to do But there is a reason for this committee and there is a reason why after 13 roll call votes for Speakership they added an additional line giving this committee the authority to look into ongoing investigations Mr Speaker I reserve the balance of my time
262	Mr Speaker I rise because Americans are completely fed up They are fed up with being targeted And the assertion that I just heard that MAGA Republicans are domestic terrorists the assertion that this is happening throughout the country I must tell my 90 year old grandmother Mr Speaker this assertion has been made time and time again that MAGA Republicans will blow something up that MAGA Republicans are terrorists Listen we have seen censorship and meddling by former intelligence community experts and current Federal law enforcement agencies against Republicans and preventing media stories from actually coming to light This is a fact My friend from Texas just talked about the IRS and other agencies that have done this We are not standing idly by and it is time that the truth comes out When we say things like MAGA Republicans I think we should all be very careful and not be disingenuous because there are plenty of good Americans and patriots that are willing to stand up to get the truth out
263	Mr Speaker it is important that free speech be upheld protected free speech be upheld Not libel not slander and not any sort of assertion that all MAGA Republicans are bad because we know that that is not true In fact there are many good Americans that are standing up for their rights
264	Mr Speaker the gentleman just got up and made all kinds of assertions that things were just said that weren t said I don t know what the hell he is talking about Mr Speaker I will again urge my colleagues to vote no against the creation of that committee because this is unprecedented This is a witch hunt This is a committee designed basically to protect those who quite frankly are under investigation right now Mr Speaker I reserve the balance of my time
265	Mr Speaker in order to enforce our laws we give terrifying powers to such agencies as the FBI the IRS and the CIA among others The misuse of these powers to effect political outcomes would be fatal to freedom and it is the hallmark of any dictatorship This our Constitution was written to prevent whoever is in power Now in recent years we have watched the IRS target individuals because of their political beliefs We have seen a glaring double standard in the enforcement of our laws by our Justice Department based on the political beliefs of their targets We have seen their powers used to intimidate citizens into silence whether the Tea Party or parents questioning their school boards Most alarmingly we have seen the use of the FBI and our intelligence agencies to suppress political viewpoints disagreeable to those in power or to manufacture or propagate one of the greatest scandals in American history the Russian collusion hoax Now when a government can interfere with the elections that govern it and when agencies can act independently of the outcome of these elections then democracy will die This select committee is designed to get to the bottom of these alarming allegations and I would hope the Democrats would be just as eager to sort this out as the Republicans After all it was not that long ago that these powers were turned against the left and could be again if we do nothing As Madison warned Democracy alone is not enough to protect our liberty for in a pure democracy 51 percent of the people can vote any time to throw the other 49 percent in jail That is why we have a Constitution which limits the powers of government through checks and balances like this Congress and like our Bill of Rights and it is why each of us takes an oath to support and defend it Let us all honor that oath today
266	Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr Speaker let me just make this clear for my colleague A change was made in this legislation and it was not just to allow the committee to investigate ongoing criminal investigations which is quite nefarious in and of itself Originally it was only supposed to be able to have investigative authority over the Department of Justice DHS and the FBI the CIA and the IRS were added This was all done after 13 Speaker votes at 10 o clock at night clearly in an attempt to win more votes The people who are asking for these changes are the same people who want to investigate the people who are investigating them This is really really unprecedented I don t know what the hell is going on here but this isn t right This isn t openness and this isn t transparency My friends talk about corruption This is corruption This is unacceptable The American people ought to know it and reasonable colleagues on the Republican side ought to say no to this Mr Speaker I reserve the balance of my time
267	Mr Speaker I thank my friend from Oklahoma for yielding My friends on the other side of the aisle are so concerned all the time about civil rights having the majority for the last few years they are not interested They are not interested in what the American people or the little guy has been enduring every day when he comes home from a hard day s work He watches the TV and asks How many more times do I have to say huh I told you so We just had Social Security numbers of the targets of the so called J6 investigation released to the public Huh I told you so No surprise there What about the school board association working in collaboration with the White House working in collaboration with the White House and the Department of Justice to intimidate American citizens Thirty miles from here just a little drive from here a young lady was raped A schoolgirl was raped and her father was concerned about her safety and had the gall to question the school board And what does he get Persecution and intimidation by his own Federal Government I told you so We all told you so People on important committees in this institution lie on national TV over and over and over again with no consequence They come home and say Yeah I told you so That is not a big surprise here The Federal Government is collaborating with Big Tech to silence Americans voices Where are their civil liberties The Federal Government is collaborating with Big Tech and the health agencies to silence information that concerns the health of every single American citizen Yeah I told you so How many more times I ask the minority How many more times do we have to say I told you so before you will recognize the overwhelming power and the abuse of power by this Federal Government Will you ever do anything about it Do you know when you want to do something about it When you think you have the Presidency in 2024 and you try and regain this House then you are going to be all into it investigating all your enemies That is not what the Federal Government is supposed to be for It is supposed to protect our civil rights so we don t serve it but so that it serves us
268	Mr Speaker I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for yielding Mr Speaker the very words expressed by those opposed to this committee demonstrate the dire need for this committee We have gone 4 years without oversight and to quote Shakespeare The lady doth protest too much methinks Those who argue against transparency may have something to hide So I listened very closely when I heard the former chairman of the Intelligence Committee give the reason that maybe we shouldn t ask for this information from the intelligence community He said that the intelligence community after this committee may be reluctant to share information with Congress and that Congress needs to craft legislation I would suggest if they are reluctant then they are disqualified from holding these positions If they have grown so big that they are no longer accountable to the branch of government that created them that funds them and that is responsible for their oversight then they need to be hemmed in I implore my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to populate this committee with serious Democrats I know there are some over there I have worked with them We have cosponsored amendments on privacy over the past decade Some of them have passed Please populate it with serious Members Please to my colleagues on this side of the aisle give us the resources we need to do this job If I may rebut one thing that man said on the other side of the aisle about ongoing criminal investigations he said that it is unprecedented that Congress would engage in an investigation that involves an ongoing criminal investigation What was the January 6 Committee This is not unprecedented It is what you wasted millions of dollars on over the past 2 years Mr Speaker I urge adoption of this rule and support for the committee that it will create
269	Mr Speaker I would just say in response to the gentleman who said that he hopes that we populate this select committee with serious Democrats that he populate the committee with Republicans who did not ask for a pardon and who did not have their phones seized by the FBI Mr Speaker I reserve the balance of my time
270	Mr Speaker I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for yielding Last week as I fought as one of the 20 conservative Members to secure victories for the American people by dismantling this institution s broken system and restoring this people s House as it should be part of the status quo here in Washington which we fought to change is politicians making empty promises of government accountability But believe me in this Mr Speaker when we vowed accountability is coming we meant it Establishing the Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government hands the House a powerful tool to uncover the two tiered justice system that is rotting our Republic It is no secret that alphabet agencies have been dangerously weaponized against the American people As an alarming example the FBI has coerced citizens to relinquish their Second Amendment rights and has used Big Tech companies as private sector proxies to silence Americans free speech It is time to thoroughly investigate our Government agencies atrocious behavior and abuse of power in disregarding and destroying America s precious freedoms and this select subcommittee will have the teeth to do just that I thank Speaker McCarthy and Chairman Cole for their invaluable support in bringing this resolution to the floor for a vote Mr Speaker I urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting for this resolution so we may deliver transparency answers and yes accountability to the American people as we have promised
271	Mr Speaker I include in the Record an article from The Hill titled Perry won t agree to stay off new House committee investigating January 6 probes From The Hill Jan 8 2023 Perry Won t Agree To Stay Off New House Committee Investigating Jan 6 Probes By Julia Mueller Rep Scott Perry R Pa on Sunday wouldn t pledge to stay off the possible new House committee that would investigate probes into the Jan 6 2021 attack at the U S Capitol despite being a subject of a Department of Justice DOJ inquiry into the matter Why should I be limited why should anybody be limited just because someone has made an accusation Everybody in America is innocent until proven guilty Perry said on ABC s This Week Host George Stephanopoulos pressed Perry asking Doesn t that pose a conflict to you since you re also part of the investigation So should everybody in Congress that disagrees with somebody be barred from doing the oversight and investigative powers that Congress has That s our charge And again that s appropriate for every single member regardless of what accusations are made I get accused of things every single day as does every member that serves in the public eye Perry countered Newly elected Speaker Kevin McCarthy R Calif has indicated the Republican majority just sworn in plans to review the work of the House select committee that last year probed Jan 6 and look into the federal investigations DOJ investigations seized Perry s phone in connection with the rioting and obtained email exchanges between Perry and former Trump attorney John Eastman among others Perry also introduced former President Trump to Jeffrey Clark whom Trump considered appointing as attorney general in order to propagate his claims of election fraud during the 2020 presidential contest
272	Mr Speaker I yield myself the balance of my time Mr Speaker the American people want us to roll up our sleeves and get to work They want us to make progress and deliver results that help them in their day to day lives They don t need Congress to bend and break to the will of MAGA extremists and they definitely don t need us to push crazy conspiracy theories and go on witch hunts to settle political scores My friends in their rules package gutted the Office of Congressional Ethics and here they are with this new subcommittee which threatens our safety our security and our freedom It is an unprecedented attack on our Nation s law enforcement agencies our justice system and our intelligence community Mr Speaker I would just say to my colleagues who spoke before about the intelligence oversight we have an entire Select Committee on Intelligence that has oversight responsibilities on those matters I am sorry the gentleman who spoke doesn t have confidence in whom the Republicans are going to propose as chair This committee is deranged It is a bad idea and it will go down in history as one of the worst committees that a Congress has ever put forward It will be in the same category as the Joseph McCarthy Committee on Un American Activities or the Benghazi Committee which now Speaker McCarthy admitted was an attempt to try to take down Secretary Clinton But here is the deal and here is what it is all about There are six on the other side of the aisle who asked for a pardon from President Trump They did his dirty work but Trump left them hanging He did not give them a pardon So now they are effectively trying to pardon themselves with the creation of this select committee This is unconscionable It is so blatant Again the changes that were made to give them the ability to pardon themselves were done after the 13th Speaker vote in the dead of night to try to win their votes over This is not the way this Congress should run This is not the way Republicans or Democrats or any majority should behave People should be ashamed of themselves that this is in the rules package and that this is what my friends are pushing right now We are better than this We should not be going down this road My friends said that they want to combat inflation and that they want to make the lives of the American people better Let s focus on those things Let s focus on areas that actually improve the lives of the American people This is a colossal waste of time But even worse it is to me the epitome of what corruption is all about Mr Speaker I urge a no vote and I yield back the balance of my time
273	Mr Speaker I yield myself the balance of my time In closing Mr Speaker I urge all my colleagues to support this resolution creating the Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government In the 1970s it was apparent from revelations in the popular press that the American intelligence community had committed abuses as part of their activities In response Congress created the Church Committee which investigated these abuses and brought them into the light Today it is again apparent that the Federal Government has been weaponized for political purposes Like the Church Committee which this subcommittee is modeled on the Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government will investigate the abuse of Americans civil liberties and bring them into the light I am confident that this subcommittee will do the American people a great service They deserve to have confidence in their government and that confidence starts with ensuring that the vast powers of the executive branch are not abused Mr Speaker I urge all Members to vote yes on the resolution and I yield back the balance of my time
274	Mr Speaker I rise today in strong opposition to H Res 12 a dangerous resolution whose passage would Establish a Select Committee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government or more accurately a subcommittee that would threaten our nations safety security and freedom MAGA Republicans love to hide behind the idea that they are pushing an agenda that would help the American people but let s see this for what it truly is a blatant assault on our democracy our law enforcement agencies our justice system and our intelligence community and an attempt to shield the twice impeached former president from ongoing investigations being conducted by the Department of Justice The establishment of this subcommittee would give Republicans the ability to investigate any agency that can collect information or otherwise investigate citizens of the United States and gives the most right wing members of the Republican party access to confidential documents solely intended for the members of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence This gross misuse of power will have dangerous implications and unintended consequences and could potentially expose general operations of our national security infrastructure which will put American lives at risk The passage of this resolution would also give MAGA Republicans the ability to interfere in ongoing criminal investigations including those investigating the extremist insurrectionists who lead the brutal attack on this institution two years ago In this country no one is above the law and to suggest that some people should be because they don t agree with the force of the law being applied to their activities is contrary to the very fabric of fairness justice and equality that America was founded on This is a blatant attempt by House GOP members to stifle the federal government s investigatory powers claiming that conservatives are being prosecuted and silenced The new Select Subcommittee comes as federal agencies such as the Department of Justice are investigating the GOP and its allies in multiple criminal investigations Members of the Republican party have been on press tours announcing this new subcommittee and have laid out their agenda but how would this subcommittee help the American people in anyway For a party that claims to be pro law enforcement the Republican party is now getting ready to undermine the hard work of our law enforcement and surveillance agencies Mr Speaker what really is the intent here I can tell you what I think it is It is a back door effort to handcuff the current administration in their normal and usual course of operations Mr Speaker I urge all my colleagues to oppose this dangerous and a completely irresponsible Resolution that will put the lives of Americans at risk and is a political stunt to further advance their dangerous conspiracy theories

278	Mr Speaker I rise to give thanks to the men and women who keep us safe Yesterday was National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day a day to be grateful for the officers who have dedicated their lives to serving their communities Created in 2015 this day allows us to voice our appreciation to law enforcement officers for their service National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day has become increasingly more important in light of the growing negativity towards officers According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund there are more than 800 000 sworn law enforcement officers serving in the United States Law enforcement officers don t enter this career because of the recognition that they may receive they choose this career because of their passion for public service These officers knowingly put their lives on the line every day because they know protecting and preventing crime creates a safer world A simple way to show our law enforcement we care is to thank a police officer So if you see a police officer please thank a police officer Mr Speaker I want to give my most sincere thanks to the men and women of law enforcement for the dedication sacrifice and commitment to the rule of law they display every day
279	Mr Speaker I rise today to talk about the Republican decision to cut funding from the Internal Revenue Service This funding was part of President Biden s critical Inflation Reduction Act The 80 billion for the IRS enforcement would have forced tax cheating corporations and wealthy Americans to finally pay their fair share Instead Republicans chose to rescind 72 billion of that money and forced a 2 percent cut to the agency funding in the last spending package The IRS support would have collected billions in taxes boosted our economy and lowered the Nation s debt ceiling issues that the Republicans claim are important Instead this vote shows Republicans prefer to protect the tax evading secrets of the wealthiest 1 percent and not give tax breaks to hardworking American families that need it the most It makes them shameless corporate stewards and embarrassing public officials
280	Mr Speaker I rise today to celebrate the recently crowned 2023 College Football National Champions the Georgia Bulldogs This is the second year in a row the Dawgs have won the national championship The team finished with a 15 0 record and had a Heisman finalist quarterback Stetson Bennett In the championship game the Dawgs demolished the TCU Horned Frogs 65 7 This is the largest bowl win in FBS history The First District s very own Stetson Bennett finished the night with 304 yards and 6 touchdowns He was also named the offensive MVP I personally congratulate Nolan Smith Micah Morris Warren McClendon Jack Podlesny Darris Smith and all of our other First District players Congratulations to the 2023 national champions the Georgia Bulldogs Go Dawgs
281	Mr Speaker the population ought to be aware of the fact that very late in the last month the administration released the new figures on what we will call legal immigrants crossing into this country This was before there were any changes in title 42 and a lot of the focus lately has been on title 42 We had another all time record in November with 210 000 people crossing the border and staying here This is a national scandal Just making a brief appearance at the border shouldn t get Joe Biden off the hook 210 000 By comparison a year ago it was 140 000 Two years ago it was under 25 000 When you are going under 25 000 to 210 000 that should be the headline in every paper of the country and I don t care whether you release the numbers late in the day on a Friday or not I hope this institution does all we can to pick up the mantle that President Biden has dropped and do something about the massive increase in illegal immigration
282	Mr Speaker I rise today because I believe this Congress has a chance to do what is right I am an unflinching optimist and I believe that we can come together to make our communities safer and more just for all As the first woman and mother in history to represent my district in Congress and as an attorney that has worked for our Nation s top law enforcement agency keeping our communities safe is a top priority of mine because violence of all kinds takes a massive toll on the people we represent Just 2 years ago a friend of mine Romito Jones was shot and killed in our neighborhood on the southeast side of Grand Rapids He was a father of five and a friend to my family Just last month a recently elected member of the Muskegon Heights school board Julius Muhammad was shot and killed in his home He was a dad and a public servant He was loved and admired by his community Today I honor their lives as I strive for safer communities for all We must come together to enact commonsense reforms to keep our neighborhoods safe support our law enforcement and support fair and equitable enforcement of the law I am ready to get to work and I invite all of my colleagues to join me

284	Mr Speaker on behalf of the incredible people of Oakland County Michigan and Michigan s 11th District let it be known that the very first action of the new Republican majority was to add 100 billion to our national debt to aid the ultra wealthy and the non tax paying corporations to add to our deficit at the expense of the middle class We saw this before Mr Speaker In fact we have seen this time and time again threats to the fiscal integrity of our Nation ballooning of our debt and the Democrats come in time and time again to clean it up Since being sworn into Congress my office has helped more than a thousand constituents navigate IRS related issues illustrating the ongoing and vital need for adequate funding for this Nation helping people who are seeking a tax return helping the small business owners The most rewarding call you can make as a Member of Congress Have I helped you today The truth is Mr Speaker we must unite we must continue to come together and we must continue to deliver for the people who elected us
285	Mr Speaker all of us are concerned about the bullying of Communist China I hope as we move forward this committee that has been voted on will emphasize the bullying but it will not emphasize the negativism that occurred during COVID with Kung Flu and dealing with the intimidation and the increase of Asian hatred and violence That is why some of us were concerned enough not to support this legislation Mr Speaker let me also say that in addition to wanting us to do better I am excited about introducing the Battle Buddy Check legislation that has our veterans check on each other just as if they are on the battlefield to stop the rise of veteran suicide Have a battle buddy This legislation is hopefully to save lives of our soldiers who are now veterans who have done all that they could for America Mr Speaker I am excited about the introduction of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Congressional Gold Medal Lyndon Baines Johnson will be looked upon as one of the greatest Presidents giving opportunity to those who never had it in education and healthcare and the environment and criminal justice reform and the right to vote and civil rights I ask my colleagues to join me in the Congressional Gold Medal for Lyndon Baines Johnson

288	Mr Speaker l rise today in opposition to House Republicans Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party CCP The purported focus of this Select Committee is essential to the national security and economic vitality of the United States Unfortunately there is a consistent trend by some in the House Republican Conference and unfortunately by many across the country to use xenophobic rhetoric that enflames violence bias and hate crimes against members of the Asian American and Pacific Islander AAPI community Let me be clear The CCP has an egregious record on human rights and forced labor especially regarding the Uyghur people Additionally the CCP consistently uses underhanded economic tactics like manipulating its currency stealing intellectual property and using unfair trade practices to undercut American companies and gain an unfair advantage in the global market The CCP s record does not however mean we should condone xenophobic rhetoric fearmongering or attacks on individual people and AAPI community in the United States This is especially concerning after the recent spikes in hate crimes and violence against Asian Americans In 2021 hate crimes against Asian Americans increased by 339 percent and in 2020 they increased by 124 percent Many of my colleagues across the aisle have invoked racist terms like the China virus to ignore our own responsibility to safeguard public health throughout the COVID 19 pandemic Under the Trump Administration the Federal Bureau of Investigation s China Initiative profiled Asian American researchers in the United States as conducting espionage on behalf of the CCP The China Initiative led to numerous false accusations quashing opportunities for affected researchers and failed to demonstrate any effective results until wisely Attorney General Garland ended this program It is necessary to grow the United States global leadership and dedicate resources that strengthen our scientific enterprise bolster research and development grow our domestic semiconductor manufacturing base and onshore critical supply chains That is what Democrats did in a bipartisan manner last Congress by passing the CHIPS and Science Act Unfortunately most of my Republican colleagues opposed this bipartisan economic competition legislation when it passed the House and was subsequently signed into law by President Biden Under the leadership of President Biden CHIPS and Science will put our nation on a path to reassert our international economic strength Expanding the market for U S goods will help businesses grow in this country Oregon exports everything from computer chips to potato chips and more exports means more jobs at home Competing globally necessitates a level playing field for all nations including China And when the playing field is level America wins Although I remain hopeful that this Select Committee might be an important forum to focus on priorities for economic and national security priorities we must make it clear that xenophobia hate crimes and stigma against Asian Americans have no place in our nation I am heartbroken and infuriated by the violent attacks on members of our AAPI community and vandalism against AAPl owned businesses Additionally there are existing committees in the House with jurisdiction over the related issues that already have authority to examine and make progress on these important matters And the Select Committee lacks legislative authority so it will not deliver the solutions that House Republicans argue it will be working toward Members of these existing committees have the experience necessary many from our work last Congress on CHIPS and Science to take the nuanced approach required to address these challenges For these reasons I cannot support the formation of this new Select Committee

307	Mr Speaker l rise in opposition to H R 26 and H Con Res 3 two pieces of legislation that yet again seek to limit access to reproductive health care and insert politics into personal reproductive health care decisions H R 26 is a deliberately misleading bill that effectively politicizes abortion care and criminalizes doctors This bill is offensive to those who face pregnancy complications and opens the door to political interference when families are making difficult complicated and often heartbreaking medical decisions This legislation is based on false claims it vilifies families and the doctors who care for them and carelessly misleads the public about these rare and complicated scenarios When a family is dealing with the unthinkable an infant that will not survive they should be able to hold and comfort their child and peacefully say goodbye If this bill were to become law forced medical intervention would cut short parents final moments with their child and doctors across the country would face extreme penalties simply for doing what is best for their patients H Con Res 3 is nothing but a political move by the extreme Republican House majority that is both disingenuous and puts actual health care clinics at risk Let me be clear I condemn violence in all its forms However this resolution only focuses on protecting pro life pregnancy centers and faith based women s health clinics not medical facilities Here s a fact attacks on abortion providers and clinics are on the rise increasing 128 percent in just one year The resolution before us falls short of fully condemning political violence and I encourage my colleagues to stand together and condemn all violence so that everyone can have the freedom to access reproductive health care without fear

313	Mr Speaker the American people expect Congress to address the issues they care about kitchen table issues like being able to afford prescription drugs or get a good paying job and addressing the gun violence that is plaguing our neighborhoods But instead of getting to work for the American people House Republicans held hostage by MAGA extremists spent their first week engaging in power struggles and brawls and political stunts Instead of lowering costs for American families they voted to help wealthy tax cheats and greedy corporations avoid paying their fair share of taxes a move that would raise the Federal deficit by over 100 billion Instead of creating better paying jobs they launched a new committee to chase down conspiracy theories and settle scores for the disgraced twice impeached former President Instead of working to make our communities safer they doubled down on their crusade to criminalize women s healthcare and end reproductive rights across this country The party that once claimed to stand for family values has no interest in solving the most pressing issues facing American families I am disappointed but never discouraged No matter what political stunts House Republicans pull my colleagues and I will remain focused on delivering for the people we represent We will keep working to create better paying jobs and opportunities for our children to lower costs for families and to make our communities safer Political Violence is Never the Answer
314	Mr Speaker as political violence rises in our country and abroad our Nation s leaders should be united in condemning political violence in all forms as well as the vile rhetoric that fuels it From Charlottesville to Pittsburgh to El Paso we have seen the tragic results when lies spill blood and words echo as gunshots These attacks ripple through communities stealing innocent lives traumatizing survivors and inflicting pain on those left behind The underlying drivers of domestic violent extremism antigovernment sentiment racism misogyny and anti Semitism are constant as threats and attacks move from one community to the next We all have a moral responsibility to combat this scourge of hateful rhetoric to ensure that every American can live free from bigoted speech and hate fueled violence But the resolution presented by Republicans today continues that pattern of stoking grievances and chaos in our communities rather than helping our communities work together to ensure domestic tranquility Their resolution is far from a clean condemnation of political violence By condemning only vandalism and violence against anti abortion facilities it gives tacit approval to the far more frequent attacks against abortion clinics and other medical centers disfavored by the radical right Political violence is never the answer I look forward to working with our colleagues across the aisle when they are ready to take seriously the very real threat of political violence condemning such violence in all forms rather than using this issue to stir up more division chaos and ultimately more violence
315	Mr Speaker I rise today to bring attention to the devastating impacts of droughts and floods that have been exacerbated in part by climate change in California but also around the country and around the world California is being battered with major storms bringing flooding and high winds across our State Normally we need the water but not quite at this level and at this measure We need to be taking advantage of the heavy precipitation to shore up our water supplies to fill our State s critical reservoirs and recharge our aquifers that have been depleted not only over decades but the last 3 years as a result of extreme drought The fact is California gets most of its moisture unlike parts of the country from November to March If we don t get it then we don t get it at all The acceleration of the cycle of droughts and floods caused by climate change and more demands in California s water system more people more needs have made it more difficult for farmers to put food on America s dinner table I know I am a third generation farmer Now the ongoing storms and floods threaten to damage our crops California s San Joaquin Valley which I represent a part of grows nearly a quarter of the United States food and has been bearing the brunt of it all Since 2019 farmland in California has shrunk by 10 percent resulting in over 750 000 acres of fallowed land Nearly 12 000 agriculture jobs were lost statewide representing a 2 8 percent decline A total of 1 3 million acres were left unplanted compared to 2019 most of it within the San Joaquin Valley Sadly we see that example here And the surface water deliveries in the valley were cut by nearly 43 percent a complex State and Federal water system Zero percent were to agricultural allocations You can t grow food without water Our farmers feed the world and they can t do that without a reliable water supply Forty four percent of California s agriculture is exported Last year Congress enacted the bipartisan infrastructure law the largest infrastructure investment since the Eisenhower administration These projects must be accelerated to develop additional water storage and to expand access to water for farmers in the valley and throughout the State In these efforts we secured 1 15 billion for western agriculture water storage an important first step 25 million for the San Luis and Delta Mendota Authority which increases 130 000 acre feet of additional water storage 30 million for Sites Reservoir to pursue off stream storage that will provide 1 5 million acre feet of water 82 million for the Los Vaqueros Reservoir that will expand another 115 000 acre feet of additional storage and 15 million to construct the Del Puerto Canyon Reservoir another 82 000 acre feet of off stream storage If all of those would be in place today that would be an additional 2 million acre feet of additional water supply for California during these flood times Unfortunately these projects are not built We must get about that business These investments along with the ongoing Friant Kern Canal construction already underway show that we can and will improve our water system to sustain our future with climate change and other factors For decades sadly we did not make these investments and we need to do so to protect our communities and farmland against extreme weather events for our country and for the world Water will rival energy in the next 10 years as to whether or not nation states can live together amicably It is critical Finally we took a large step by investing in this bipartisan infrastructure But the flooding that we see here obviously is our current ongoing problem Our Federal agencies must work quickly and we must use all of the water tools in our water toolbox to prevent future disasters like this from destroying our State and for other water basins like the Colorado River and the Mississippi River All of these are known to experience periodic flooding and periodic droughts We must act now
316	Mr Speaker our postsecondary education system is in dire straits Reforms are more necessary now than ever To start with income driven repayment plans have left millions of borrowers trapped under a mountain of interest Many of these borrowers have done everything right They have been faithful to make their monthly payments yet years later find they have made little to no progress on their principal This can be extremely frustrating especially for those who realize they have already paid back the original cost of the loan This is the kind of problem that needs to be fixed It is critical that we address the structural problems that plague our postsecondary education financing system for the students of tomorrow but it is also crucial that we address the problems it has caused for the students who have already been harmed today That is why House Republicans put in the work and offered a solution that fixes this broken system That solution begins with the REAL Reforms Act This legislation protects the interests of students and taxpayers by providing targeted relief for borrowers currently struggling while implementing lasting reforms to ensure it doesn t happen to future borrowers This legislation also implements reforms to simplify the number of repayment options and caps unlimited graduate lending while ensuring college remains accessible and affordable to all Americans regardless of their financial circumstances It also saves taxpayers billions by eliminating runaway forgiveness programs that disproportionately benefit wealthier households Together these reforms will lower the cost of college for students families and taxpayers In contrast President Biden s radical student loan bailout will exacerbate tuition inflation while encouraging students to go deeper into debt Blanket loan cancellation to the tune of 400 billion and enacting retroactive free college by expanding what were intended to be limited safety nets is fiscally irresponsible and morally indefensible Republicans and Democrats agree on the problems and we must come together to work toward a solution For example everyone agrees that postsecondary education should provide students and taxpayers a positive return on investment There is bipartisan consensus that the cost of nonrepayment can no longer fall squarely on taxpayers For far too long colleges have been more focused on getting students in the door and have paid little mind to what happens once they are there or once they leave Again there is bipartisan consensus that this too needs to change It is time for Congress to come together and fix the mess created by these failed policies My Republican colleagues and I stand ready to work with the President and congressional Democrats to do so Republicans Stand for Life
317	Mr Speaker House Republicans remain undeterred in our mission to protect the sanctity of human life and the rights of the unborn Today we will pass the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act and H Con Res 3 which condemns violence against pro life institutions and groups By passing these two pieces of legislation we are fulfilling the commitment we made to the American people to preserve a future that is built on freedom Over the last 2 years the American people witnessed unprecedented attacks both on the unborn and those who stand for life Today we are turning that tide House Republicans are sending a unified message to the entire country and the world Our new House majority stands for life
318	Mr Speaker I rise today in opposition to the extreme anti abortion agenda that my colleagues on the other side are advancing despite clear opposition across our country In November Mr Speaker access to abortion care was on the ballot and the American people rejected the Supreme Court s decision to overturn Roe and refused to allow far right extremists to take away their right to bodily autonomy Voters in Vermont in the Speaker s home State of California and in my home State of Michigan codified abortion rights in their State constitutions Voters in Montana as well as Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell s home State rejected attempts to restrict their access to reproductive freedom Still they are advancing a policy agenda to criminalize abortion nationwide with no exceptions for rape or incest Let me be clear Abortion bans impact and endanger the lives of many of our residents including those who live with disabilities We will have many fights ahead of us Mr Speaker and I will continue to hold the line to push back against the policy violence by those who want to continue to inflict on the American people the extreme right agenda We will continue my colleagues and I to mobilize and organize a movement to secure reproductive justice across our Nation and I will continue to fight like hell until abortion rights are restored as the law of the land Palestinian Human Rights
319	Mr Speaker I rise today as the only Palestinian American serving in the United States Congress I feel a strong responsibility Mr Speaker to humanize the Palestinian people who are living under increasingly oppressive and racist apartheid policies 2022 was one of the deadliest in memory for Palestinians Dozens of children were killed by the Government of Israel and many were targeted Groups like DCI Palestine that monitor these killings were targeted We cannot look away Mr Speaker and gaslight the oppressive and violent policies toward the Palestinian people who are experiencing right now literally the taking away of their human dignity and their right to be able to freely live and raise their children without this type of targeting We can t keep handing over billions each year to an apartheid state violating human rights We are dealing with a far right government there now promising to make things worse They are not even hiding it Mr Speaker They are intentionally saying exactly what they are going to continue to do which is the status quo again making it very dangerous for Palestinians to live and thrive No person not one Palestinian Israeli anyone deserves to suffer or die for who they are what they believe or where they were born The sooner we end unconditional support for Israel s apartheid government the sooner we can begin making good on that belief Today I am thinking of my Sity my grandmother who deserves to have human dignity She should not be denied of who she is solely because she was born Palestinian to be able to feel safe and to be able to have human rights I am also thinking today Mr Speaker of the Palestinian American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh and the countless Palestinians who deserved to live but whose lives were cut short I thank the Speaker for at least trying to listen and hear from someone who again is connected to so many folks on the ground there who deserve to be seen and heard in this Chamber
320	Mr Speaker I rise today to speak on the powerful winter storm systems that are currently impacting my district and much of the State of California Rainfall in recent weeks has been several times above average which along with severe winds has had devastating and cascading impacts This includes flooding in Folsom and Lincoln avalanches and mudslides The Tahoe area and Mono County are currently under avalanche warning There are localized mudslides occurring in Plumas County There have been road closures from downed trees hundreds of downed trees that have disrupted travel plans power outages affecting roughly 345 000 Californians 4 500 people in the Third District and hundreds of school closures including all schools in the Lake Tahoe Unified District There have also been tragically at least 17 deaths in the State including 5 in the Sacramento area I extend my most sincere sympathies to everyone who has been affected who has been harmed and whose lives have been disrupted I also extend my most heartfelt gratitude to all the first responders who are working tirelessly to mitigate these impacts and to protect life and property My office is working to ensure the greatest measure of Federal assistance is available to the affected communities FEMA has issued an emergency declaration for most counties in California now including Placer Sacramento El Dorado and Yuba My office is in constant communication with FEMA and I have spoken personally to FEMA Regional Administrator Bob Fenton who briefed me on the State Operations Center in California We are also in close contact with local authorities including members of the boards of supervisors in affected counties and continue to closely monitor developments as more storms are expected Mr Speaker California now finds itself in both a flood emergency and a drought emergency at the same time That absurdity underscores a fundamental failure of governance Citizens are told to take shorter showers Farmers are told to fallow their fields All the while they watch water flow abundantly into the ocean An estimated 8 billion gallons of water from these storms will flow into the ocean in the Los Angeles Basin alone Cycles of wetness and dryness are nothing new to our State Joan Didion in 1977 wrote California summers were characterized by the coughing in the pipes that meant the well was dry and California winters by all night watches on rivers about to crest Yet since that time we have done little to build the storage capacity that is needed to stabilize our water supply That is why I am cosponsoring the WATER for California Act to expand our storage capacity We must also strengthen our flood defenses to be better prepared for extreme weather events in the future Our focus right now is on the days ahead These storms are impacting different areas very differently so it is important to be closely attuned to the advisories of your local government On my website we have a comprehensive emergency contacts document that constituents in affected areas can access for resources and phone numbers You can find that at kiley house gov
321	Mr Speaker I rise to celebrate the life and legacy of Bill Steiner who devoted his career to making Orange County a better place He held many elected positions serving on the Orange Unified School District school board the Orange City Council and the Orange County Board of Supervisors However his true passion was his work for children Mr Steiner founded the Orangewood Children s Home in Orange and the Good Samaritan Boy s Home in Corona He also served on the board of directors for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children for over 16 years While we miss him dearly his legacy lives on and his organizations will have an untold impact on countless children He is also an active member of the Rotary Club of Orange In that capacity Mr Steiner epitomized the motto Service Above Self and we are all better because of his tireless work We will miss him dearly Celebrating Villa Park s 61st Birthday

323	Mr Speaker I am proud to recognize Korean American Day Since the first Korean immigrants arrived on January 13 1903 Korean Americans have made their mark from sea to shining sea and have found success in the classroom workplace and even right here in Congress to make our Nation a better place As one of the first Korean American women to serve in Congress and as an immigrant from South Korea today I reflect on the sacrifices my family made in the aftermath of the Korean war to have the chance at a better life here in the United States I remain grateful for those who came before me and paved the way for someone like me to have a seat at the table and I will always fight for freedom and opportunity for all Americans
324	Mr Speaker I rise to offer perspective on the purpose and mission of this 118th Congress Mr Speaker I am honored to speak here on the House floor for the first time I am the first nuclear submarine veteran to serve in the United States House of Representatives in the last 50 years and only the second in our Nation s history One particular submarine patrol we pulled into Pearl Harbor to take World War II veterans out to sea with us for the day By naval tradition we stood at attention and saluted the USS Arizona as we passed by One part of the experience we shared with these veterans was to demonstrate the tremendous pressure of the ocean In the control room with the periscopes we would tie a string from one side of the hole to the other about the width of this rostrum behind me Our submarine s hole is made of high strength steel to keep the water out and the crew safe On the surface this string would be taut like a guitar string and would sit about a foot off the deck But as we submerged our boat the pressure of the sea would compress the hole and that string would begin to droop By the time we reached many hundreds of feet below the ocean that string would lay flat on the deck The incredible pressure of the ocean visible for everyone to see Now like that submarine that I served on America is under tremendous pressure And like that string sitting on the deck we can all see it It is inflation It is the border It is the lawlessness of our Federal agencies It is clear that our Nation is in trouble The failed policies of the current administration are only taking us deeper and deeper Now with a Republican majority led by Speaker McCarthy we have the leadership for this critical moment in time In 1963 the nuclear submarine the USS Thresher was conducting engineering trials off of Cape Cod when they encountered an engineering problem The crew was able to bring the boat to within 100 feet of the surface but they lost their battle as the submarine descended below what is called the crush depth all hands were lost Americans have voted for a Republican majority in this House to reverse the policies of the current administration and to start to relieve the pressure that is all around us The commitment to America is exactly that plan for exactly that purpose to unite this Chamber and to lead America back to safer waters A typical submarine crew would be about a quarter of the number of seats in this Chamber Imagine for a moment that many people together in a steel tube hundreds of feet below the ocean for months at a time I have spent 500 days at sea and I can tell you that after so many days not everyone on the boat is going to like each other The thing about submarines is there is no easy way off No matter what we think of each other at the end of the journey we arrive in the same place together Let s talk about where we want to end up For starters when something is broken on the submarine you don t scuttle the boat with the crew aboard You keep fighting to fix what is broken triaging critical systems and getting the boat to a safe depth That is exactly what we witnessed last week as we chose Speaker McCarthy He has been chosen to restore faith in this Chamber and unite our party Freedom is a fragile thing We saw that under Democrats one party rule A strong Republican Conference is key to securing a better future for our children our grandchildren and for generations to come
325	Mr Speaker I have heard the women of Congress come to the floor one by one by one to tell their personal stories about abortion I am a very private person and I just couldn t do it I didn t want to relive the most painful time in my entire life But yesterday I read these startling statistics about my State yes the great State of Florida the beautiful Sunshine State with all the beaches and the theme parks and the immigrant rich communities my Florida my State If abortion is banned nationwide Florida will be the most impacted State seeing maternal deaths increase by 29 percent That is the mother The Nation will see a 24 percent increase in maternal deaths with a disproportionate 39 percent rise in maternal mortality for Black women All I ever wanted since I was a little girl was plenty of children that I could love and cuddle and raise to greatness That was the school principal in me even back then So after getting married in 1968 I would soon become a mother to be It was the joy of my life I was ecstatic My husband was walking on the clouds My husband and I would touch my stomach all the time just to feel the movement of our baby boy and the glory of a life growing inside of me It was amazing Then at 7 months the baby stopped moving He was soon pronounced dead right inside of my womb and the doctor was prohibited by law from inducing labor I had to learn how first of all to handle the immense grief that comes with losing a child and the fact that the corpse of that child was still within me I cried every night and all day My little body was wretched with pain weakness and frailty I lost 50 pounds I would crawl into a fetal position in my mother s lap most of the day and in my husband s most of the night I beg you I plead with you we can t go back Lord have mercy please have mercy on women like me I almost died As the days became weeks and the weeks became months the baby began to disintegrate and the flesh from the corpse began to spill into my bloodstream I was at risk for toxic shock Poison was flowing through my grief stricken little body At 8 1 2 months I went into labor hard painful labor and what was left of the baby Wilson boy was born Oh what a day Oh what pain Oh what grief Oh what despair Oh what suffering After 3 days I left the maternity ward in a wheelchair emptyhanded no baby nothing I watched other mothers and families celebrate their newborns while I grieved and cried We had a small graveside burial for baby boy Wilson and the doctors were so afraid that I would also have had to have a graveside burial Do not take us back to the days before Roe v Wade Everyone who needs reproductive healthcare is different Abortion does not only apply to women who have decided for themselves they are not ready to have a child Abortion affects women who are at risk of facing medical emergencies life altering emergencies and death God of our weary years God of our silent tears let the women march on and on till victory is won You cannot put young childbearing women at risk because of a group of ludicrous hateful majority male Congressmen who have no idea what it feels to even bear the pain of childbirth or even have the courage to carry a child for 9 months and who take pride in monitoring women s vaginas How dare you How dare you How dare you May God help you find it in your heart to hear my story and never wish that kind of pain and grief that I experienced on another living soul Praise God from whom all blessings flow

327	Mr Speaker I rise today to introduce the Restoring Normalcy in America Act In a little over a week we will be 3 years past the first recorded case of COVID 19 in the United States and over 2 years since the COVID 19 vaccine has been available thanks to the rapid development under Operation Warp Speed Despite the time elapsed President Biden and his administration continue to prolong the pandemic promoting policies that are destroying our economy burdening small businesses and hurting Kansas families Just yesterday the NFIB announced that their Small Business Optimism Index declined 2 1 points in December making it the 12th consecutive month below their 49 year average The December jobs report was the worst of 2022 and the worst during the entirety of the Biden administration so far With out of control spending in the name of COVID relief rampant inflation has made real average hourly earnings fall 1 9 percent since last year the 20th month in a row that inflation has outpaced wage growth following the implementation of the so called American Rescue Plan in March of 2021 While Washington was under total Democrat control President Biden increased Federal spending continued lockdown procedures for far past their effectiveness and held the country hostage until his self chosen vaccination rates were reached Receiving the vaccine is a choice a choice made with careful consideration between a person and their doctor not an action that can be forced by the Federal Government When the Biden administration failed to achieve their vaccination goals they forced through unconstitutional vaccine mandates We are currently experiencing near historic lows of COVID hospitalizations and 41 States have ended their states of emergency Yet the Biden administration has decided to extend the COVID 19 public health emergency despite in September President Biden stating that the pandemic is over The continuation of the public health emergency significantly strains State and Federal budgets when we are already combating inflation and rising prices These actions by President Biden and the administration have hurt the American people and stunted our recovery It is long past due that Washington is accountable for persistent pandemic restrictions placed on the Kansans I represent The legislation I am introducing today holds the Federal Government responsible and is a step toward restoring normalcy through five objectives of research accountability process access and restoration The American people deserve answers from the Federal Government on the effectiveness of the forced Biden administration COVID 19 policies My bill requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct research on the effectiveness of vaccines and current treatments the rate of transmission of COVID throughout the public health emergency and more importantly an investigation into the origins of COVID 19 We also need accountability Over the past several years trillions have been allocated to combat COVID 19 To ensure that taxpayer dollars are not being wasted my legislation would audit the Federal agencies that received COVID 19 funds and whatever finances can be recouped should be returned to Treasury Returning to our standard processes is also critical In the early stages of the pandemic using the Emergency Use Authorization the EUA was necessary to develop vaccines and treatments Now with years of information and time we should return to the normal approval process This bill ends the use of EUAs for COVID vaccines and treatments and requires any vaccines or treatments without full FDA approval to go through the process like any other medication or vaccination The choice to be vaccinated is personal and whether it be for religious or medical reasons vaccination status should not be the cause for discrimination and access My bill strengthens personal freedoms by preventing businesses from prohibiting entry or refusing service based solely on COVID vaccination status Lastly my legislation reverses the damage done by President Biden s destructive unconstitutional vaccine mandates and brings restoration to the individuals harmed Any servicemember or Federal employee fired or discharged due to failure to comply to Biden s vaccine mandate will be reinstated with their record expunged of this incident The Restoring Normalcy in America Act provides the American people with answers and accountability for how this administration has prolonged the COVID 19 pandemic and works to reverse some of the damaging policies that have been put in place
328	Mr Speaker I guess the opportunity to serve in the United States Congress with a little over 10 000 Members over the decades and for the years of service that I have been given this privilege and at the decision of my constituents allows me to look over the landscape of the journey that we have taken I was here when medical procedures for parents who wanted nothing more than a healthy baby were then characterized as a criminal act and called partial birth abortion when a mother had to make a decision with her God her doctor and her family I remember the hearings in the Judiciary Committee where mothers were crying because of the medical procedure that was necessary to save their life We have now come full circle and the extremists want to again demonize parents who are desperate desperate for a healthy child I have seen this before extremist views criminalizing a medical choice that has to be made criminalizing abortion from east to west and north to south I will not have it I know that this is a most personal decision and one that families do not want to make But as a person of faith I believe it should be that woman that family that God and that doctor So unfortunately today we will have the effort to criminalize these actions of doctors You see Mr Speaker I come from a State where the State legislature and Governor passed a bounty hunter bill to go after doctors and nurses who would be giving medical care to innocent women and to individuals who were seeking that care How outrageous in a constitutional democracy Mr Speaker that you want to injure people and you want to undermine doctors and undermine nurses What an outrage that again this extremist agenda continues Yet in the face of a 13 year old being shot to death in the District of Columbia with a gun the guns are rampaging across America guns of a 6 year old who shot a teacher mass murders are more extensive in this last year 2022 than ever there is not a real effort to ensure that guns are not proliferating in the hands of those who should not get them guns that should actually have penalties for those who do not store it penalties for manufacturers who do not indicate label and insist that the guns be stored or in fact the universal background check that has not been able to be passed These are things that could save lives of living individuals who are now at the brunt end of gun violence Yes putting guns in the hands of people who should not have them having better mental health services and red flag laws But the way the bill was written you have to opt in States like Texas will not opt into a red flag law to protect people And all I see in my area is not because police are not working as hard as they can domestic violence with guns day after day after day and week after week because guns are in the hands of the wrong people So Mr Speaker I stand here today to say there is a lot of good work we can do together there is a lot of good work that Democrats have done We are seeing it in the bipartisan infrastructure bill and dealing with climate change which is evident by the tragedy that is happening to our friends in California But I am glad to stand up here today and announce something really good that today because of Democrats the Social Security recipients will have an 8 7 percent increase in their COLA I will go home over the weekend and over the days and into Martin Luther King celebrations where he believed in lifting the least of those and be able to say to those Social Security recipients You got an 8 7 percent increase in your COLA because of Democrats and President Biden We intend to do things and to be active on behalf of the American people We intend to cure problems and not make problems We intend to help our schoolchildren help our teachers help our nurses help our doctors and help those senior citizens whom I see in the senior citizen community centers saying When are we going to get the ability to have a cost of living so that we can live because we have been the ones who have helped build this Nation Finally Mr Speaker I want my colleagues and the administration to be unafraid of moving forward on H R 40 Isn t it time that we assess the impact of slavery in this country Over 200 years it has never been addressed It has never been addressed H R 40 needs to pass on the issue of studying slavery and developing reparation proposals
329	Mr Speaker I rise today in support of H Con Res 3 condemning the recent attacks on pro life facilities groups and churches New York is home to so many compassionate and committed pro life pregnancy centers such as CompassCare in Amherst New York and CareNet Centers dotted around New York State Pro life pregnancy centers across our State and our country provide women with critical care such as free pregnancy tests pre natal care referrals education mentoring and material support including diapers car seats and clothing They also provide love and support to these women in a time of need From 2016 to 2020 these pregnancy centers saved over 800 000 lives by providing a compassionate alternative to abortion Tragically on June 7 2022 a CompassCare facility in western New York was maliciously firebombed by a violent anti abortion group called Jane s Revenge The perpetrators left graffiti Jane was here Those responsible have still not been held accountable Unfortunately this was not an isolated incident Over 100 pro life facilities and churches were attacked in 2022 alone I was honored to join CompassCare s CEO Reverend Jim Harden and the CompassCare team at its reopening just a few months after the violent attack As Reverend Harden said best CompassCare now has 21st century telehealth tools to compete head on with the billion dollar abortion empire by reaching and serving every woman in America Pro life pregnancy centers play a key role in helping pregnant women all across the country but Democrat leadership has been silent on the unprecedented amount of violence leveled against these compassionate advocates for life House Republicans are united in our condemnation of the political violence these wonderful caregivers and those who choose life have always faced I am proud to support H Con Res 3 condemning the recent attacks on pro life facilities groups and churches and I will not back down to violent extremists
330	Mr Speaker I wish a very good morning to you and to the House of Representatives I am Aaron Bean I am one of the new guys Aside from a motion to adjourn earlier this week this right now is the very first time I am speaking on this floor and I want to say what an honor it is to be with everyone in this body To the people of northeast Florida and specifically the brand new Fourth District of the free State of Florida I say that I am humbled and grateful that you sent me here to be your voice on this floor I am keenly aware of the amazing opportunity it is as well as the responsibilities it comes with I am also Mr Speaker keenly aware that our country and Nation have challenges lots of them The border and our growing deficit are just the tip of the iceberg So I say to all the Members here I look forward to working with you tackling these challenges and making America more secure safer and stronger Mr Speaker let s go get em
331	Mr Speaker for most of my life I have been a student of history As a CPA a tax lawyer and a former head of the second largest tax agency in this country I focused on the fact that if you look at empires republics and kingdoms the ones that succeeded were those that were able to collect taxes And when they were unable to collect taxes they fell I have seen patriotic anarchists come to this floor They want America to be strong but they want our ability to enforce our financial laws to be weak There are those who say correctly that we should not defund the police because we have crime in the streets But we also have to prevent crime in the suites Yet every time a billionaire successfully cheats on his taxes a member of the Freedom Caucus earns his wings There are two threats to our ability to collect taxes Both of them seem to be supported by many on the Republican side The first of these is the underfunding of the IRS For 3 days and 3 long nights we heard each faction of the Republican Party say how they wanted procedures that would eventually lead to reducing our national debt and then the first thing they bring to the floor is a bill that increases the national debt by 1 6 trillion according to six bipartisan Secretaries of the Treasury Frankly I think that estimate is way too low because I have seen tax collection from every side as a legislator as a tax administrator and auditor and as an adviser to private businesses When you conduct audits you not only bring in money from that taxpayer but you create an image in that social circle that tax returns need to be filled out accurately and even conservatively That will no doubt lead to far more tax collection than the 1 6 trillion that has been estimated Keep in mind that working people really can t evade taxes They get W 2s and 1099s It is those with complicated tax returns and our large corporations that we are talking about Now with the additional funding the Democrats have provided the IRS we can finally put service back into Internal Revenue Service Hopefully they will answer the damn phones We need to see one IRS employee for every 2 000 tax returns that are filed As you can see on this chart that is what Ronald Reagan had back in 1988 Now we are close to 3 500 tax returns for every IRS employee That is untenable That is why Donald Trump could take outrageous positions in his tax returns He counted on light audits Ronald Reagan paid his taxes and staffed the IRS Stand with Ronald Reagan and stand with adequate funding for the Internal Revenue Service There is a second threat to our ability to collect taxes it is longer term and that is the possible rise of cryptocurrency When somebody tells you what they are believe them Cryptocurrency tells you what it is or aspires to be in its name Cryptocurrency literally means hidden money Now I am the only Member of this House to get a grade of F from the only organization dedicated to crypto advancement that rates Members of this House because I have been trying to ban crypto for over 5 years No one has helped me more in that effort than Sam Bankman Fried but some will view Sam Bankman Fried as just one big snake in a crypto Garden of Eden The fact is crypto is a garden of snakes From the outside it looks like it is just a token an electronic pet rock something to bet on not because it has any value or use but because you might be able to sell it for even more to somebody else But longer term investors in crypto are investing in it because they hope it becomes a currency How does crypto compete with the dollar the existing U S currency It is right there in the name Cryptocurrency means hidden money and the market for cryptocurrency is tax evaders trying to hide their assets from the IRS
332	Mr Speaker I rise today to recognize the city of Charleston in South Carolina s First Congressional District For the 10th consecutive year the Holy City has been recognized as the best city to visit in the United States by Travel and Leisure magazine It is easy to see why Charleston s tremendous natural beauty rich history and friendly faces make it a magnet to visitors from across the country To quote Travel Leisure s article The city expresses the perfect balance of Southern charm knockout food and drinks and walkability When they say drinks they mean some of the best cocktails in the South I want to commend our tourism and hospitality industry our mayor and every resident of the city of Charleston for this decades long recognition Saving Sea Turtles

337	Mr Speaker in my first remarks before the 118th Congress I rise today to share with you what I learned from my first term representing the Big First District of Kansas and how I will respond over the next 2 years I grew up on the farm south of Quinter Kansas that has been in my family for five generations The house my parents live in and the house I grew up in is the same house my great great grandfather ordered from a Montgomery Ward catalog in the early 1900s Growing up there meant that I spent thousands of hours on a tractor working in fields and on horseback doctoring cattle in our family feed yard I think of the Big First as the pilot light of America because the values that make America great are still alive and well there People in the Big First are good people who carry a pioneering spirit with them the same way those who settled my State did over 160 years ago We know one another look out for one another and sacrifice for one another We are farmers and ranchers feedlot managers businessowners lenders bankers teachers doctors nurses and parents Over the last 2 years I did a lot of listening I held listening sessions each month I received tens of thousands of calls emails and letters from Kansans I hosted leaders and other Members of Congress in the district to listen with them I hosted townhalls 126 times over the last 2 years and I am gearing up to start my 2023 townhall tour again next week As I travel across the district I hear concerns about inflation the border crisis Big Government sweeping executive orders out of control government spending sky high taxes and the infringement on basic rights like the Second Amendment and the right to life I have long said if it matters to a Kansan it matters to me In response to what I heard over the last 2 years and to what I have seen while serving in Congress I developed my Commitment to the Big First It is a roadmap for the 118th Congress that gets America back on track advocates for agriculture and advances our Kansas conservative values My Commitment to the Big First details plans for an economy that is strong a nation that is safe a future that is built on freedom and a government that is accountable It is a plan for a balanced budget and a strengthened supply chain for lower taxes and a secure southern border for a robust police and military for a comprehensive reauthorization of the farm bill and strengthened crop insurance for a maintained stepped up basis tax provision and global food security legislation that stops wars before they start Senator Bob Dole once told me about the Kansas approach honesty hard work respect for your roots service simplicity genuine thoughtful care for people and common sense My Commitment to the Big First is a plan for commonsense solutions to the complex problems that America faces today I wasted no time implementing this commitment On Monday I reintroduced the More Accountability is Necessary Now Acts or the MANN Acts The MANN Acts are six pieces of legislation that will hold the Biden administration accountable demand transparency from Washington fight unconstitutional executive orders and push back against Federal Government overreach The MANN Acts require the executive branch to notify the American public and Congress of its intent to issue any new executive orders pertaining to agriculture energy the environment pro life provisions the Second Amendment and immigration Single party rule here in Washington D C is over The American people gave Republicans control of the House for a reason They are tired of seeing their tax dollars wasted their rights violated and the laws of our land dictated by executive orders from the White House The MANN Acts and my Commitment to the Big First are just the first steps toward executing on a plan that America has demanded of us When we get into the middle of issues roll up our sleeves get to work listen to those around us and do the heavy lifting we gain perspective and better results That is what I learned in the Big First I refuse to be stapled to my desk in Washington D C I will continue to spend time thinking praying and reflecting on how best to serve the people in my district I did not come to Congress to be a caretaker of the slow demise of America I am here to fight and to work to make America stronger I really believe that our brightest days are yet to come
338	Mr Speaker if you want to understand successful law enforcement the first place to look is the career of El Dorado County Sheriff John D Agostini It is not hard It was under his leadership in fact it was because of his leadership that the day to day operations of his department became the subject of the popular TV series Sheriffs El Dorado County that ran from 2014 to 2019 It is the very definition of successful policing pioneered by Sir Robert Peel and perfected and practiced by Sheriff D Agostini Ideal police departments are run as extensions of the communities they serve They work in partnership with local citizens and this was the heart of Sheriff D Agostini s success I have seen it over and over in action During the devastating King fire I watched him at his post even when his own ranch was imminently threatened During the Caldor fire he opened that same ranch to the stream of evacuees who had fled the devastation with only the clothes on their backs I can t tell you the number of times I watched him during these terrifying disasters always calm always focused always reassuring and omnipresent He is loved by his community and his department because he loves them and that caring is what binds the community to the sheriff s department and exemplified and indeed defined his successful record of modern policing He was first elected in 2010 by a razor thin margin of 1 300 votes but as he proved himself he became a beloved institution in the community and won reelection overwhelmingly in 2014 and 2018 and would have won by acclimation in 2022 but for the fact that he chose to retire back into the community he has so faithfully served and protected They were not all easy years He lost a deputy to an illegal alien in a marijuana grow in 2019 and became a national figure warning of the dangers that our porous border and sanctuary policies present to communities across America and to those who risk their lives to protect us When State bureaucrats ordered businesses to shut down during the COVID hysteria Sheriff D Agostini stood up for the constitutional rights of his constituents and refused to destroy their livelihoods His courageous stand has since been affirmed by the mounting evidence that the lockdowns cost lives destroyed livelihoods and did nothing to slow the spread of the disease Sheriff D Agostini worked his way up through the ranks first graduating from the Sacramento County Sheriff s Academy in 1993 Throughout his career Sheriff D Agostini served in numerous positions including patrol deputy detective SWAT team member narcotics investigator rangemaster and firearms instructor and investigator for the Amador County District Attorney s Office Sheriff D Agostini is well known for his many accomplishments and contributions to the community including his leadership in constructing a new public safety headquarters located in Placerville This building now provides local law enforcement with emergency operations services a 911 dispatch center a morgue an evidence building and a special operations and training building as well as an indoor shooting range and armory Mr Speaker without law enforcement there is no law and without law there is no civilization which is why it is impossible to overstate the necessity of our local police departments and the law and order they uphold within our communities I am proud today to congratulate John on his numerous accomplishments and his exemplary leadership and on behalf of the grateful citizens across El Dorado County thank him for his extraordinary service El Dorado County has been extremely fortunate to have had his leadership for these past 12 years Although he isn t going anywhere he is retiring right back into the community that raised him and although his successor is well prepared under his tutelage to carry on his successful policies that won t stop us from missing him anyway in the role that he defined and the responsibilities that he discharged so well

346	Mr. Speaker I rise today to address the ongoing crisis at our border When President Biden took office in January 2021 he inherited commonsense immigration policies such as remain in Mexico and title 42 that worked to keep our Nation safe reducing the flow of illegal drugs and gang members Unfortunately President Biden immediately ceased construction of the border wall and enacted policies favoring illegal immigrants over Americans Thankfully the Supreme Court has challenged the legality of President Biden s policies and overturned the removal of title 42 Now it is Congress time to act Both Republicans and Democrats acknowledge that our immigration system is broken but only Speaker McCarthy s Commitment to America has a plan to repair our broken immigration system This Congress Republicans will pass legislation that secures our border stops the influx of illegal drugs and criminals and ends catch and release loopholes and human trafficking Americans deserve a government that works in their best interest and these policies will create a safe and secure Nation I would also like to wish a very happy birthday to my L D Kyle Jacobs

348	Mr. Speaker I rise today to celebrate National Milk Day Today is a great day to raise a glass of milk in honor of our dairy farmers who work 24 7 to bring fresh nutritious and delicious milk to our tables every single day We celebrate National Milk Day on January 11 because on this day in 1878 milk was delivered in sterilized glass bottles for the first time I am proud to come from a long line of dairy farmers According to the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture Pennsylvania has 500 000 cows producing more than 10 2 billion pounds of milk annually The Keystone State ranks seventh in milk production in the country and Pennsylvania is also second nationally in the number of dairy farms with 6 200 farms across the Commonwealth Agriculture is the number one industry in Pennsylvania with the Pennsylvania dairy industry providing 52 000 jobs and generating 14 7 billion in annual revenue Mr. Speaker please join me in celebrating National Milk Day and thanking our dairy farm families for their continued efforts to provide us with such a delicious and nutritious treat
349	Mr. Speaker I rise today to express opposition to H Con Res 3 The resolution is nothing but a political move by extreme Republicans that is both disingenuous and actually puts healthcare clinics at risk This resolution only focuses on protecting pro life pregnancy centers and faith based women s health clinics which are not medical facilities Let me be clear I condemn violence in all of its forms In fact here is a fact At clinics that provide abortion services attacks are on the rise increasing 128 percent in just 1 year This source is from the National Abortion Federation report The resolution before us today falls short of condemning violence The Pro Choice Caucus resolution that I support condemns all acts of violence on healthcare personnel patients and facilities and affirms that everyone has the freedom to access reproductive healthcare services without fear of violence Let us all stand together and condemn all acts of political violence
350	Mr. Speaker I rise today in defense of the most vulnerable population the unborn As we consider the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act and the concurrent resolution to condemn attacks on pro life pregnancy centers I hope that it is those innocent lives on our hearts and minds I implore my colleagues to stand with me in pursuit of doing what is right by as I say those voiceless and vulnerable and to consider the divine worth of every human life that we have taken an oath to serve from womb to tomb It is written in Psalm 139 For You created my innermost being You knitted me together in my mother s womb I praise You because I am fearfully and wonderfully made your works are wonderful I know that full well We should do all in our power to stand for life and to ensure that the unborn get to live out each of the days that God ordained for them before one ever came to be Let us unite as a legislature to determine that in the United States we will preserve the most basic right to life and the ability of good willed Americans to provide life affirming care in pursuit of that cause
351	Mr. Speaker what an important topic limited to 1 minute but I rise today to acknowledge Human Trafficking Awareness Day to acknowledge that a Texas woman just filed a lawsuit against one of our universities for sexual abuse and the grooming by her coach to use her over and over again Human trafficking is one of the greatest threats to human rights in the United States In 2020 over 11 000 instances of potential human trafficking were reported to the United States National Human Trafficking Hotline and at least 70 percent of those were in fact estimated to be sex trafficking I am delighted that Chairman Mike McCaul and Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee myself have introduced the Stop Human Trafficking in School Zones Act because that is one of the largest sites for trafficking We look forward to a bipartisan Congress supporting this legislation that will particularly provide enhanced sentencing to those who would dare to recruit our children at schools and they do it all across the Nation Mr. Speaker I hope that we are aware today is Human Trafficking Day and that we recognize we must do something to stop it
352	Mr. Speaker I rise today as our Florida Keys are under a state of emergency The President s unwillingness to secure our border coupled with his pathetic policy of appeasement and concessions to the brutal Castro regime in Cuba have created a migratory crisis unlike any other that the Florida Keys has seen in decades Since August 2022 alone Federal State and local law enforcement have encountered nearly 10 000 people in waters off the coast of Florida and the Biden administration is directly responsible Dry Tortugas National Park has already been forced to close because of this crisis affecting the tourism dependent economy of our Florida Keys constituents boaters and tour operators and the Biden administration is directly responsible Secretary Mayorkas has repeatedly demonstrated abdication of his responsibilities as leader of the Department of Homeland Security and failed to enforce our public safety immigration laws That is why I am calling on him to resign immediately Governor Ron DeSantis quickly activated the National Guard and I commend him on behalf of my constituents for his leadership and bold action I am calling on the Biden administration to take action now We must reimburse Monroe County and the State of Florida for local resources that have been expended to process and care for the latest wave of migrants We need to increase Customs and Border Protection onsite in Monroe County and provide additional resources to the Florida Keys
353	Mr. Speaker the Supreme Court s decision to overturn Roe v Wade was dehumanizing and dangerous It does not reflect the will of the majority of Americans who deeply value control over their own bodies As leader of the State senate in Vermont I worked to make sure that my State was the first in the Nation to explicitly protect reproductive freedoms in its constitution It is time to provide these same protections for all Americans While Republicans seek to control women s bodies to try to distract us from their extreme stances with farcical resolutions my Democratic colleagues and I will not stop until reproductive freedoms are restored as the law of the land The American people are overwhelmingly with us They want their rights They want their freedoms As a woman as a mother as a Congresswoman I will continue to fight for a world where abortion care is legal safe and accessible for all Americans
354	Mr. Speaker I am honored to stand here today on the floor of the House of Representatives to serve as the voice of east Texans in Congress As a man of faith and father of four children I rise today for the very first time as a Member of Congress to stand for the sanctity of life and in full support of children nationwide I can think of no better cause than the cause of life Mr. Speaker I thank my colleague Congresswoman Ann Wagner for bringing this valuable bill to the floor I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act which will ensure that all children who are born are protected and treated the same as any other newborn Every life is a gift Every life has a calling divinely given by God I stand firmly committed to protecting those lives and to opposing any action that threatens them This legislation is the next step in our effort to protect our future generations and return to our Nation s values
355	Mr. Speaker I rise today because at a time when Americans across the country are facing urgent needs Republicans are choosing to spend the first week of Congress attacking women s reproductive healthcare This week we should be advancing legislation to fight inflation and lower everyday costs for families who are struggling to make ends meet We should be passing measures to improve our education system and address our dire workforce shortages Instead Republicans are doubling down on their assault on women s reproductive freedom even though the vast majority of Americans believe that women should have the right to choose I came to Congress to make a meaningful difference in people s lives and fight against extremism just like this The people of Colorado s Seventh Congressional District sent me here to ensure these personal decisions are kept between women their doctors and their families not Members of Congress Just like I did in the State senate I will not stop fighting until all Americans have control over their own bodies their own healthcare decisions and their own lives
356	Mr. Speaker I rise to voice my opposition to legislation brought before this body today Our focus in this Congress should be to guarantee the American people have access to accurate health information including their reproductive health As we talk about crisis pregnancy centers today we need to be clear and transparent about what these centers are actually able to do and most importantly not do Too often people go to these centers expecting a certain level of care due to their misleading name but they cannot actually get the medical attention they deserve and need They target low income and minority communities and shamefully insinuate that they are healthcare providers when they are not As such these centers are inherently contributing to misinformation that fuels the high infant and maternal mortality across our country which disproportionately impacts Black women and babies If we are serious about protecting life we need to be honest and these centers need to be honest and provide transparent information about the services they provide to pregnant women and their families I hope this Chamber will work together to find real solutions to improve maternal and infant health outcomes for the American people Lives are certainly dependent upon it Mr. Speaker I urge my colleagues to oppose the legislation before us today
357	Mr. Speaker I rise today with the solemn duty to honor the life of Brackenridge Police Chief Justin McIntire who was gunned down in the line of duty last week His family and my community mourn Chief McIntire today at his funeral as does this House and this country Chief McIntire was a hometown hero in Brackenridge and a life long resident of the area He gave his neighborhoods 22 years of selfless service as a police officer Day in and day out like so many who wear a badge or a uniform Chief McIntire put himself in harm s way to keep others safe ultimately giving the last full measure of devotion He represents the very best of western Pennsylvania the very best of America So too does Tarentum Police Officer Jordan Schrecengost who was shot and wounded in the line of duty that fateful day and is recovering Although Chief McIntire s watch has ended we will never forget his sacrifice
358	Mr. Speaker in September of 2022 President Biden declared the pandemic is over Despite this he has continued to extend his public health emergency declaration Declaring an emergency gives the President overreaching authority over Congress and the State health departments While this emergency is in place the Federal Government can keep States from removing ineligible people that the rolls should be cleaned up from the Medicaid rolls and the welfare state will keep growing unchecked This declaration has enabled the emergency use of vaccines and allowed the President to mandate involuntarily those vaccines to vast swaths of the public with little input or debate from Congress and the courts It has also given him legal cover to buy votes with attempts at student loan debt forgiveness rent freezes and eviction moratoriums Under the cover of this declaration the President attempted to change laws impose decrees and has altered the economic life of millions of Americans very negatively This is setting a terrible precedent by allowing the executive branch to rule by decree with no oversight or input from Congress He is replacing Congress speech and debate with his own Presidential pen This gross overreach of authority must end and move back to a debate and an open process
359	Mr. Speaker I rise today to commemorate the life of James Thomas Wilbun of Fort Worth Texas Born November 7 1918 in Hope Arkansas Mr Wilbun grew up there where he obtained his education including agriculture school A dedicated veteran Mr Wilbun served in the United States military during World War II For his service he was given a number of honors including recognition at the World War II museums in Washington D C New Orleans Los Angeles and a ceremony that I was able to attend for him several years ago in Fort Worth Following his career in the military he built a career as a landscaper and also served with the Fort Worth Independent School District until he retired A great listener and a happy man Mr Wilbun loved gardening listening to gospel music going to church laughing and he was an avid fan of the Texas Rangers and the Dallas Cowboys But most of all he loved spending time with his friends family children great grandchildren and great great grandchildren along with a host of other relatives I want to end by commemorating Mr Wilbun for 104 years on this Earth and to his service to the city of Fort Worth and our independent school district Mr. Speaker our prayers go out to all of his loved ones
360	Mr. Speaker I rise today to condemn the violent attacks on the pro life organizations and facilities in the wake of the Dobbs leak and subsequent overruling of Roe v Wade There has been very little accountability for the leaked draft opinion and ensuing violent intimidation against pro life activists That is why this resolution is so necessary It makes it crystal clear that violence property damage threats and intimidation tactics must be condemned and they must have consequences for those who do this violence I am proud of the work of the Palmetto Women s Center in Rock Hill South Carolina in my district as it does tremendous work The Biden administration needs to use all appropriate law enforcement mechanisms necessary to uphold public safety and protect the rights of these pro life groups and facilities Just because this administration doesn t agree with protecting the unborn doesn t mean they should turn a blind eye to violence and intimidation
361	Mr. Speaker in every State where abortion rights were on the ballot last year Americans voted to protect lifesaving reproductive care In Republican strongholds like Kentucky and Montana voters rejected attempts to restrict or ban abortion In Vermont Michigan and California voters codified abortion rights into their State constitutions After such a resounding defeat for anti abortion politicians you would think that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would have gotten the message But rather than listening to voters and bringing forward legislation to codify the reproductive rights our mothers and grandmothers fought so hard for the new Republican majority is catering to demands of extreme Members in their conference who have called for a national abortion ban The partisan bills on the floor today will do nothing to protect women Instead they will undermine access to reproductive care that millions of women rely on Mr. Speaker the women we represent deserve better Our daughters deserve better I urge my colleagues to oppose these pieces of legislation
362	Mr. Speaker I rise today to honor Nebraska s 41st Governor the newly inaugurated Jim Pillen After traveling to all 93 counties in Nebraska putting 100 000 miles on his truck Jim has become a very well known man but I also wanted to share a little bit about his story with you Jim is the son of a tenant farmer and a seamstress What most people don t know is that Jim came from almost nothing He is a self made man His entrepreneurial spirit built Pillen Family Farms into a company with international success If you have eaten bacon in the last decade you have probably enjoyed the work of the Pillen family which reaches all the way from hog genetics to meat processing and everything in between The pig farmer is wasting no time as Governor He has already rolled up his sleeves getting to work raising awareness about human trafficking fighting for school choice and making government more efficient Jim has pledged to bring people together to make Nebraska better day by day Our Nebraska delegation is excited to work with him to move the State forward
363	Mr. Speaker what is one of the first things that Republicans do when they take over the House They shaft the taxpayers and increase the budget deficit by 114 billion a year By seeking to roll back the 87 000 additional personnel for the IRS which is intended to replace a 20 percent reduction in head count in anticipated retirements they guarantee that taxpayers will have to wait weeks for their phone calls to the IRS to be returned They guarantee that the budget deficit will be increased by 114 billion for lack of audits of tax avoiding multimillionaires Shaft the taxpayers and increase the budget deficit by 114 billion Great work GOP
364	Mr. Speaker I rise today to support H Con Res 3 This resolution condemns the recent attacks on pro life facilities across the country Since the Supreme Court Dobbs decision there have been over 100 attacks on pro life organizations and churches in the U S causing life affirming centers across the country to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in security fearing they may be targeted next In Idaho life affirming organizations provide critical services to women For example Stanton Healthcare in Meridian Idaho recently helped Leandra a young mother facing an unexpected pregnancy with encouragement through pre and post natal care and education childbirth classes material assistance and mentorship resources This resolution shouldn t be controversial It simply highlights that acts of violence and intimidation are unacceptable and have no place in our society But it is important for all of us to call out this violence and condemn it Mr. Speaker I thank Congressman Mike Johnson for taking the lead on this resolution and for his efforts to promote life
365	Mr. Speaker I unequivocally condemn all acts of violence vandalism and destruction of property However these acts are not all the same Graffiti on the side of a building is not comparable to the stalking of doctors and nurses and the assaulting of patients who try to access healthcare Yet 38 of the 39 incidents listed in this resolution concern attacks on property not people In fact the lone act of assault mentioned in this resolution took place when an individual targeted a healthcare facility for providing abortions and then attacked police officers striking them multiple times So yes the only threat to human life mentioned in this resolution was an attack on abortion providers and on patients who are seeking care and the law enforcement officers defending their right to provide and seek such care Today I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to join me in condemning the countless acts of violence against abortion providers and patients that they face every single day accessing care in this country
366	Mr. Speaker I have been reminded during these first days of the 118th Congress of the importance and significance of an open U S Capitol I have had a number of guests from my district here with us this past week as the people s House has finally been reopened to the public Yesterday I had Bode Brewer and his family with here with me the excitement awe and inspiration that I saw in this young man s eyes in viewing this Capitol as well as the opportunity he had to meet so many of my colleagues who play such a significant role in this House was truly profound Today I am visited by my constituent Cadet Aidan Carr whom I nominated to United States Military Academy West Point and who is in his third year at the Academy Not only does Aidan have a clear sense of honor being here with us but he is carrying himself with a great sense of respect patriotism and sense of duty for the commitment he has made to protect this country and this institution So as we begin the 118th Congress I hope we all are reminded of the responsibility we have in this House to serve the American people in the greatest country on Earth
367	Mr. Speaker I rise today to condemn intimidation tactics of pro abortion activists Since the very day the Dobbs v Jackson decision was illegally leaked acts of violence against pregnancy centers places of worship and other pro life institutions have skyrocketed Cases of vandalism harassment firebombings and physical assaults have been reported all across the country in communities big and small In addition to the actual acts these violent acts amount to intimidation of those individuals that need the services provided by these pro life faith based organizations Not only has President Biden and his administration failed to condemn these attacks but his Department of Justice has also refused to take any action to identify and prosecute those that have committed these crimes This is curious considering the way that this administration has been weaponized against so many American citizens that haven t committed any crimes at all Over 100 attacks have taken place in the last 8 months alone Every Member of Congress Republican and Democrat should join in condemning the violence of these extremists The rule of law matters the sanctity of life matters and equal justice matters
368	The concurrent resolution shall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the majority leader and minority leader or their respective designees The gentleman from Ohio Mr Jordan and the gentleman from New York Mr Nadler each will control 30 minutes The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio General Leave
369	Mr. Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr. Speaker the FACE Act prohibits threats of force obstruction and property damage intended to interfere with reproductive healthcare services Let me just go over that again It prohibits threats of force obstruction and property damage intended to interfere with reproductive healthcare services The Justice Department has said that this act is not just about abortions but applies as well as to pro life pregnancy counseling services and other pregnancy support facilities providing reproductive healthcare So it applies across the board Here is the problem On May 8 2022 Mother s Day activists targeted a pro life nonprofit center in Madison Wisconsin setting it ablaze and vandalizing it with the words If abortions aren t safe then you aren t either On June 3 2022 leftwing anti life activists targeted the Capitol Hill Crisis Pregnancy Center throwing red paint on the door eggs at the window and spray painting the window with Jane says revenge On June 25 2022 in Longmont Colorado vandals graffitied and set fire set fire to the Life Choices free pregnancy center This has happened dozens and dozens and dozens of times all across the country What has the Justice Department done To my knowledge no one has been prosecuted on the FACE Act not one single person to my knowledge But oh Mr. Speaker if you are a pro life activist and you are praying outside an abortion clinic like Mark Houck then guess what happens to you The FBI kicks in your door arrests you puts you in handcuffs and does it in front of your wife and seven children That is what happens Mr. Speaker we don t want violence anywhere As Mr Cicilline said in his 1 minute speech we don t want any violence anywhere But let s not have this double standard Not to mention this Think about what happened after the Dobbs decision was leaked the leak draft of that opinion we had activists protesting at every Supreme well not every one because only the conservative Justices names were doxed and information put out there We had protests at their homes In direct violation of the statute 18 U S C 1507 You are not supposed to be protesting and interfering when a decision is pending in front of a Supreme Court Justice s home This was a direct violation of the statute and again nothing happened That situation as we all know got real serious It got real serious with the assassination attempt on Justice Kavanaugh So this resolution is straightforward What has happened literally now at hundreds of crisis pregnancy centers and churches around the country this past year is just flat out wrong This is a resolution that says that we appreciate the good work that happens at crisis pregnancy centers where they take in women and where they help them and help that unborn child and make sure that that unborn child gets to experience the gift of life The sanctity of life is what this is all about I commend my colleague and friend Mr Johnson from the great State of Louisiana for this resolution and the people across the country who volunteer and who work every day at these centers to help these ladies who are in a tough situation Mr. Speaker I reserve the balance of my time
370	Mr. Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr. Speaker I rise in opposition to this woefully incomplete resolution I will begin by saying that I condemn violence in all its forms including the threats vandalism and property destruction described in H Con Res 3 I would also like to reiterate my condemnation of the attempted murder of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh That should go without saying I am grateful that no one appears to have been physically injured in the vandalism incidents described in the resolution and that law enforcement took Justice Kavanaugh s would be assassin into custody before he could complete an act of violence In a democracy violence is never the answer in a political dispute and it should be roundly condemned in all its forms This resolution however is a transparent partisan ploy that is a woefully and unacceptably inadequate condemnation of violence It comes in the context of extremist MAGA Republicans effort to enact a total ban on abortion at both the State and Federal levels In what appears to be a glaring omission to H Con Res 3 my Republican colleagues refused to condemn the long documented history of violence murder and mayhem perpetrated by anti abortion extremists against abortion providers and their patients According to the National Abortion Federation since 1977 anti abortion extremists have been responsible for 11 murders 42 bombings 196 arsons 491 assaults and thousands of incidents of criminal activities directed at patients providers and volunteers Sadly these incidents have increased dramatically in recent years In 2021 abortion providers faced a 600 percent increase in stalking incidents a 450 percent increase in clinic blockades a 163 percent increase in reports of hoax devices or suspicious packages a 129 percent increase in invasions and a 128 percent increase in assault and battery compared to previous years In some cases violence against abortion providers has had deadly consequences For example in November 2015 a gunman murdered three people and injured nine others when he opened fire with an assault style rifle at a Planned Parenthood health center in Colorado Springs In January 2021 a gunman attacked a Planned Parenthood clinic in Knoxville Tennessee and later that year the same clinic was burned to the ground by arsonists Regardless of your position on abortion rights Mr. Speaker it is important that we condemn all acts of violence regardless of who is the ultimate target I am concerned that by refusing to condemn violence against providers this resolution will inadvertently send a signal to anti abortion extremists that violence against abortion providers is justified by the vandalism described in the resolution If this inadequate resolution could potentially fan the flames of political discord what purpose then does it serve The only purpose I can infer is that it is intended to placate the extreme elements of the anti abortion movement while this Republican majority figures out how to pass a total nationwide ban on abortion Let me be clear Democrats stand with the majority of the American public and will oppose such a radical position H Con Res 3 is nothing more than a partisan political ploy designed to advance an extreme anti abortion agenda and is not a serious effort to condemn political violence Indeed it may have the opposite effect on the American public because it purposely fails to condemn the thousands of threats violent incidents and attacks that abortion providers and patients have endured for decades at the hands of anti abortion extremists Mr. Speaker I urge my colleagues to vote no and I reserve the balance of my time
371	Mr. Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume What purpose It says it right in the title Expressing the sense of Congress condemning the recent attacks on pro life facilities groups and churches Over 100 churches and pro life facilities have been attacked in the last 7 months That is all this resolution does Republicans condemn violence every time it happens We condemn it when it happens to abortion clinics We condemn it when it happens to churches We condemn it when it happens to pro life centers We condemned it when it happened in the summer of 2020 all over the country We condemned it when it happened on January 6 We condemn it every single time This is just highlighting what has happened in the last 7 months with churches and pro life centers around the country It is that simple This should be unanimous Mr. Speaker I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana Mr Johnson my friend and the sponsor of this great legislation
372	Mr. Speaker I rise today to speak in favor of my commonsense legislation H Con Res 3 I am really proud that this bill has been included among our very first bills that will pass in this Congress For Chairman Nadler or Ranking Member Nadler now I am happy to say to stand here and suggest that this does not fulfill the will of the American people or is somehow not the right thing to do is absurd This resolution is very simple and its language is clear It condemns the attacks that have been committed against pro life facilities groups and churches in the wake of the leak of the Dobbs opinion and the subsequent decision It also calls upon the Biden administration to take action now to bring the perpetrators to justice Who could be opposed to that In recent years there has been an alarming trend of more and more attacks on pro life organizations and individuals In the wake of the Dobbs decision the problem became much worse We have seen a significant increase in targeted violence against places and people who provide care for pregnant women and their unborn children Here are just a few of the more than 100 incidents that have taken place just in the last several months May 5 last year a Catholic church and school in Armada Michigan was vandalized with satanic symbols and messages calling for the death of Republicans May 8 the Oregon Right to Life office was firebombed May 26 seven high school students in New Jersey were suspended after physically assaulting another student holding a pro life sign June 26 a pro abortion extremist was charged with attempted murder in Los Angeles July 7 Sacramento a pregnancy care center was threatened by a man with a machete September 24 in Lake Odessa Michigan an elderly pro life volunteer was shot while canvassing door to door to discuss an abortion ballot proposal January of this year just several days ago a pro life billboard was defaced with the words kill them kids in Portland Oregon This last one that I wanted to mention is personal to me On July 11 pro abortion activists vandalized the Women s New Life Clinic in Baton Rouge Louisiana They spray painted anti life messages on the walls Being located right next to the abortion provider in Baton Rouge at the time the largest in our State this clinic has offered hope to countless pregnant women by counseling them on all of their options and not pushing them to abort their unborn children as the clinics do I am proud to call many of the leaders of that clinic in Baton Rouge personal friends We have to stand for them and stand against violence vandalism personal threats and intimidation Nationwide there are over 2 700 pregnancy care centers providing essential services in all 50 States They serve millions of women every year They have over 10 000 medical professionals supporting them They do not deserve the treatment they have endured and they certainly deserve that this Congress condemn the violence committed against them Since there has been so little accountability for the leaked draft Dobbs opinion and the ensuing violence and intimidation against pro lifers that have followed we are making the position of Congress clear today We condemn violence property damage threats and intimidation tactics and these clear violations of Federal and State laws must be prosecuted We have the opportunity before us today to start to push back against the mob that has targeted the groups and individuals that care for women and their unborn children Republicans are ready to act I am so proud that over 100 I think nearly 130 Republicans so far have cosponsored this It will pass and it should and it will be a shame if our Democratic colleagues do not join us in this condemnation of violence The question is will they Mr. Speaker I urge my colleagues to vote yes on the resolution
373	Mr. Speaker first I would like to note what is profound hypocrisy going on in this Chamber Last week we heard from the Republicans about the importance of an open process and the ability to offer amendments on all bills or resolutions but there were no hearings on this resolution no markups and amendments are prohibited If they were allowed we could have discussed and Mr Jordan could have made his statement that he believes the Justice Department says this would affect all types of facilities but we didn t have that so it is not here Every Democrat and I hope every Republican rejects and condemns political violence We settle our disagreements at the ballot box and through the rule of law not by violent actions Republicans say this resolution is about condemning violence and enforcement of laws yet it only condemns those of their favorite organizations and facilities the pro life crowd They should be aghast that they don t include the murders of the 11 people killed at abortion care providers since 1993 Dr George Tiller killed entering his church in Wichita Kansas shot in the back David Gunn shot in the head at his clinic in Pensacola Florida Just this past New Year s in Knoxville a Planned Parenthood clinic was destroyed by arson Sadly there are too many property crimes at Planned Parenthood and other facilities that help people with abortion needs to mention None are mentioned We should condemn all murders and serious violence This House did not hear from Republicans condemning the violence of January 6 when this Chamber was under attack and we should do that in all cases They are trying to undermine and obstruct the Department of Justice as well This is just some of the other hypocrisy They are having a committee to look into the attacks on America from the FBI the Justice Department and other security services Those are law enforcement That is defunding Federal law enforcement and it is wrong We should support all law enforcement and fund all of it and its activities If you want to know about the Republicans you ask them about the bill on the IRS If they wanted to help the middle class they would have brought a resolution to direct the IRS to do more audits or even all of its audits on people earning over 1 million and save the middle class and get the money where it is They did not We should listen to what they do not what they say I will vote no
374	Mr. Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume I point out to my friend from Tennessee that it is not that I believe the DOJ has the ability to use the FACE Act to prosecute people who vandalize and attack crisis pregnancy centers they have said it The Department of Justice says they can do that I am just asking why they haven t Mr. Speaker I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Alabama Mr Carl my good friend
375	Mr. Speaker I thank my colleague from Louisiana Mr Johnson for his leadership on all of these pro life issues Mr. Speaker in the wake of the Dobbs decision pro abortion radicals have waged horrific attacks on our pro life community Pro life institutions are on the front line of meeting the needs of women youth and yes men They provide critical services and support and have saved so many lives Nobody should be in fear for their safety when seeking medical care and spiritual support This body has an opportunity to express its unwavering support for women and families across America and condemn this violence by voting for this act I am proud to be part of this effort Mr. Speaker I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote yes on this resolution
376	Mr. Speaker this is a solemn moment I join my fellow colleagues the women of the Democratic Caucus to stand here because we stand in the name of those who have died 11 murders 42 bombings 196 arsons 491 assaults and thousands of incidents of criminal activity directed at our doctors our nurses and our patients After COVID 19 America woke up to the vitality and the necessity of our medical professionals but I come here today to express my concern I wish my friend from Louisiana had worked with my side of the aisle so that we would acknowledge that there has been loss of life of innocent persons who simply were providing medical care Dr David Gunn was shot and killed by an opponent of abortion during a protest A former pastor kills a doctor and clinic volunteer George Tiller twice a target is killed This legislation is an extreme initiative because it is not here to acknowledge the solemnity of which we stand first to recognize the constitutional right of a woman her doctor and her faith to be able to make a decision without fear and intimidation In a State like mine we have vigilantism because it has passed legislation for bounty hunters to come back again from the 1800s to intimidate doctors nurses and patients This is a day that we must stand against If we are to work together in this solemn moment we must recognize all the doctors nurses and patients that have been intimidated The National Abortion Federation in 2021 indicated that there has been an increase in violence The significant increases in stalking 600 percent blockades 450 percent hoax devices suspicious packages 163 percent invasions 129 percent and assault and battery 128 percent Mr. Speaker I ask my colleagues to oppose this legislation Maybe we can in solemnity work together on this serious issue Mr. Speaker I rise in strong opposition to H Res 3 a concurrent resolution that expresses the sense of Congress condemning the recent attacks on pro life facilities groups and churches It is critically important that we opposed the Republican effort to rewrite history in a way that demonizes the victims and glorifies the aggressors Each American has the right to make their own healthcare decisions according to their own beliefs values and conscience Republicans hope to strip women of their constitutional right of autonomy over their own body and their right to make their own healthcare decisions In Texas Republicans have incentivized vigilantism and stalking by passing a law that provides civilians a cause of action against anyone who performs or aids an abortion and provides for a 10 000 cash reward if successful This resolution ignores the long documented history of violence against abortion providers their staff and their patients and attempts to rewrite the facts According to Bloomberg a survey of 390 clinics showed that assaults on abortion providers surged 128 percent in 2021 with reports of kicking slapping and being pepper sprayed The National Abortion Federation 2021 Violence Disruption Report found a massive increase in violence and disruption against abortion providers The most significant increases were in stalking 600 percent blockades 450 percent hoax devices suspicious packages 163 percent invasions 129 percent and assault and battery 128 percent compared to 2020 Armed Conflict Location Event Data Project ACLED a nonprofit that tracks political violence and demonstrations asserts that anti government militias and extremist groups like the Proud Boys appearance at abortion related events spiked 160 percent in 2021 compared to the previous year Further in 2020 far right groups appeared at only 1 percent of demonstrations related to abortion rights in 2022 almost one in five events involved members of a far right group This violence harassment and cyberbullying against those who seek abortions their providers and supporters is unconscionable The American public made it clear last November that they want Congress to protect reproductive freedom We stand with all women and staunchly reject the misinformation in this bill and its attempt to cover up the attacks on basic human dignity and constitutional rights I urge all my colleagues to oppose this outrageous and dangerous resolution
377	Mr. Speaker I rise in strong support of this resolution which condemns the wave of attacks on pro life groups and facilities As a Nation we are blessed to have a nationwide network of faithful dedicated pro life pregnancy centers that provide care for pregnant women and their babies Women deserve to be offered the full range of health support that can help them in their time of need Pro life pregnancy centers do exactly that offering a compassionate support system for pregnant women Shamefully since the Dobbs decision was rendered these pregnancy centers have been under attack by radical abortion activists We have seen horrific displays of vandalism threats and intimidation directed at pro life groups and facilities for the simple fact that they support life and serve to help pregnant mothers in need No one is forced to receive care at a pregnancy center yet we see people committing violence on pregnancy centers Why Are they angry that so many choose to not terminate the life of their own baby and let their child live like all of your mothers did rather than violently terminate the life of their own baby Mr. Speaker I ask Congress to stand together and strongly condemn this violence by passing this resolution
378	Mr. Speaker I rise because I am appalled that this is how my Republican colleagues have chosen to start this majority It appears that actually legislating is too great a challenge for my colleagues who have no apparent plan to address the real issues facing our country including the rising tide of violent extremism H Con Res 3 condemns violence against anti abortion organizations It says nothing about the violence against abortion providers that has gone largely unaddressed for nearly 50 years Last year I supported legislation that offered real solutions to rising violence against abortion providers Mr. Speaker I would be happy to work with my colleagues on fixing H Con Res 3 to actually acknowledge the rising violence but I cannot and will not support it in its current form and I encourage my colleagues to vote no
379	Mr. Speaker I rise in support of the resolution before us here Last year a draft Supreme Court opinion was leaked to the media in one of the biggest scandals to ever hit the Nation s highest court It reestablished the authority of States to prohibit the killing of unborn children sending the Democratic Party and other leftwing extremists off the deep end The liberal brush fire that ignited after the opinion was leaked wasn t contained to just Washington Pregnancy centers and pro life organizations across the country soon became the target of their rage The chairman said it very well in his opening comments when he cited the situation in Madison Wisconsin If abortions aren t safe then you aren t either That is what it says right here Following the attack a radical pro abortion group known as Jane s Revenge took credit proudly proclaiming this was only a warning and next time the infrastructure of the enslavers will not survive Leftwing extremists have shown us time and time again first during the summer of 2020 when they burned American businesses to the ground and then by firebombing pregnancy centers in 2022 that they will resort to violence and destruction when they do not get their way Unfortunately there has been very little accountability for the leaked draft opinion This resolution makes it clear that violence needs to stop
380	Mr. Speaker I rise in strong opposition to the dangerous measures that House Republicans are bringing to a vote in this Chamber as part of their ongoing efforts to end a woman s right to choose and inserting politics unnecessarily and wrongly into the doctor patient relationship denying abortion care to women stigmatizing women who get abortions and putting at risk the doctors who simply are doing their jobs by caring for them All while ignoring the threats that abortion providers and patients face daily The American people sent a clear message during the midterms Politicians have no place in our personal medical decisions House Republicans refuse to listen Instead of protecting and expanding reproductive healthcare and women s rights they are making it their first order of business to use their power to control women s bodies and their future I condemn violence in all of its forms This resolution condemns only some violence and very intentionally omits violence like the murder of health professionals against abortion providers patients and their families Maybe they don t regard murder as violence This comes at the same time as women s rights are under attack This nonbinding resolution is meant to only divide and distract and will do nothing to actually reduce violence I urge my colleagues to oppose these biased bills and continue to stand up and speak out for what is right
381	Mr. Speaker I rise today in support of the resolution condemning the recent attacks on pro life groups facilities and churches Last summer in a landmark decision the United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of my home State of Mississippi in returning decisions on protecting life to the States Unfortunately the leak of the Dobbs decision led to instances of extremism committed against churches pro life institutions and crisis pregnancy centers Sadly my home State was not spared Mississippi has a robust network of crisis pregnancy centers that provide care and resources to expectant mothers I and many of my Republican colleagues have called on the Biden administration to address these criminal acts and hold accountable those who committed these offenses To date no action has been taken I am hopeful that this legislation will move the administration to act and I am grateful that the Republican majority is standing with those impacted by last year s extremist acts
382	Mr. Speaker I strongly oppose violence and destruction of property regardless of venue The resolution on the floor today however is a distraction from the real issue regarding crisis pregnancy centers which is that they regularly provide inaccurate incomplete and injurious information to people who are seeking guidance and fact based healthcare Crisis pregnancy centers often engage in deceptive advertising to get people in the door and then they mislead them about the services they provide A crisis pregnancy center in Texas for example was caught telling people that abortions cause mental illness and implied that abortions cause cancer and infertility I heard from someone who visited a crisis pregnancy center and after she left she started getting calls from strangers who were told about her visit Another woman was shown an ultrasound picture of her kidney and was told it was a baby This deception is unconscionable which is why I will soon introduce the Stop Anti Abortion Disinformation Act to direct the Federal Trade Commission to issue rules prohibiting unfair or deceptive advertising of abortion services At a time when reproductive rights are under attack it is especially important for anyone seeking abortion care to be able to find a real healthcare provider they can trust who will respect their bodily autonomy and their privacy
383	Mr. Speaker one of the scary ongoing stories over the last few years more typical of an atheistic totalitarian regime than our wonderful constitutional Republic has been a tax on pregnancy counseling centers They are hated because they try to persuade women to keep their babies and they articulate how precious life is in the womb which is considered to be dangerous speech to those who desperately want to legalize 8 month abortions Some of these attacks like those in other venues by antifa and Black Lives Matter have become more physical in nature The lack of urgency by law enforcement to protect the speech of those who want women to keep their children is dangerous This effort to muzzle those who express a wide variety of conservative Christian viewpoints has become more and more common and should scare anyone who does not want to live in a religiously hostile large government State Please vote for H Con Res 3
384	Mr. Speaker I rise today in opposition to H Con Res 3 This resolution is further proof of my colleagues hypocrisy and their obsession with controlling a woman s inherent right to bodily autonomy This resolution ignores the long documented history of violence against abortion providers their staff and their patients Violence is what Amanda Eid from Texas suffered when doctors could not induce labor after her amniotic fluid was leaking Her doctors were prohibited from providing the treatment she urgently needed because of Texas anti abortion laws Amanda s life will forever be changed and that is the real violence The American people are overwhelmingly in support of protecting reproductive freedom Women and the American people across this Nation have spoken loud and clear They do not want the government interfering with their reproductive healthcare On behalf of all women in my district and across this country I oppose this extreme resolution
385	Mr. Speaker two women spoke at a pregnancy care center dinner I attended in New Jersey Both women were effusive in their thanks that the director had approached them in absolute kindness and empathy as they were literally walking from the parking lot to an abortion clinic They changed their minds and were helped through their pregnancies and after the birth of their children as well Later in the program two young teenaged girls spoke of the sanctity of life and the good work of the pregnancy care center In a very dramatic moment from the podium because they were standing side by side they turned to the director thanked her and said that had she not reached out to their moms that day and followed up with such love and compassion both of them would have been dead Pregnancy care centers across the country have suffered a surge of violent attacks firebombing and vandalism by pro abortion activists in a coordinated effort to intimidate frontline volunteers and licensed medical professionals providing critical support to mothers in need and their unborn baby girls and boys Now more than ever the Biden administration and law enforcement needs to enforce the law
386	Mr. Speaker my my my here we go again First off let s all condemn the violence on the streets of our country This resolution is a political ploy and a distraction from the violence that abortion providers and patients face every day Bombings murder arson let s condemn these too Mr. Speaker women across our country are being denied lifesaving care and healthcare providers are being punished for doing their jobs Women deserve access to all forms of health services including abortion and the freedom to make decisions about their health and their lives and their future without interference of politicians I urge my colleagues to vote no on this resolution which sidetracks us from the real danger women and healthcare providers are facing today The Republican agenda
387	Mr. Speaker today I rise in support of H Con Res 3 and urge my colleagues to vote in favor of its passage In June of last year following the decision by the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v Wade a pro life pregnancy center that assists pregnant women in Nashville Tennessee was the victim of an attempted arson attack Thankfully no one was injured and local law enforcement opened an investigation into the situation in an effort to bring the perpetrators to justice Unfortunately that is not the case across the entire United States which is why it is essential that this body the United States House of Representatives condemns these heinous acts of political violence I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation and will always and forever stand on the right side of history when it comes to protecting the unborn
388	Mr. Speaker I rise in opposition to the bill before us today While I strongly condemn violence and vandalism in any form the bill before us neglects to address the real crisis facing Americans today which is the loss of reproductive rights for millions of Americans in the blink of an eye since the Dobbs decision overturned Roe v Wade last summer Mr. Speaker 8 in 10 Americans support the legal right to abortion something that has been seen over and over again in poll after poll in election after election This resolution is an attempt to muddy the waters and distract the public from the fact that those on the other side of the aisle support a national abortion ban regardless of which State you live in In fact it was abortion providers who faced significant increases in stalking invasions and assault and battery as a result of the Dobbs decision I cannot support this resolution which conveniently leaves out the majority of the victims of this type of political violence I urge my colleagues to vote no
389	Mr. Speaker attacks on churches and pro life pregnancy centers are unconscionable and un American Thugs elevate their extreme political ideology over the most basic gift from God Life This phenomenon is fed from here We all recall Senator Schumer s threat to Supreme Court Justices that they will pay the price Now we see the price firebombing pro life pregnancy centers and assassination attempts In my own State there is rhetoric amid the broken windows red paint and anarchist symbols If abortions aren t safe neither are you That sentence is repeated over and over across this country That is a threat This is the death cult s echo of the KKK s burning cross on the lawn brazen violent intimidation The Federal Government responded to the KKK Where is the Biden Justice Department amid this violent campaign of national scope Mr President it is time for action Do your duty
390	Mr. Speaker I appreciate the gentleman s courtesy in permitting me to speak on these resolutions This is a poll tested focus group effort to change the subject We all know that attacking facilities or not providing healthcare to an infant is already illegal This is a veiled attempt at distracting from the real consequences of the Dobbs decision People have had their rights taken away and can no longer receive the care they wish When we see doctors consulting their lawyers when patients are dying on operating tables because they are afraid of abortion bans voting on this resolution is an embarrassment It is unconscionable that when people are living in fear even dying because they are denied healthcare the House is ignoring this in favor of a political stunt I stand with the American public and in opposition to this legislation
391	Mr. Speaker I rise in support of this resolution Being a mother is the greatest gift in the world and childbirth is a true miracle of God In 2019 pregnancy centers served roughly 2 million women men and youth They provided services such as medical care education mentoring and material support like diapers car seats and clothing From 2016 through 2020 pro life pregnancy centers partnered with pregnant women at risk for abortion to save over 800 000 lives Approximately 75 percent of women at risk for abortion who view an ultrasound of their baby in the womb at a pregnancy center ultimately make the choice to continue their pregnancy Merrick Garland calls parents who want to protect their kids from sexual indoctrination in schools domestic terrorists but refuses to protect facilities that help pregnant women carry their babies from being attacked by far left extremists Since the Dobbs decision was leaked in May 2022 alone approximately 40 churches and 60 pro life pregnancy centers have been firebombed and vandalized across the country by pro murder extremists The costs of damages for each attack range from less than 100 to more than 250 000 Shameful Some of the things they have said they have spray painted on a church in Lansing Michigan abort the court and death to Christian nationalism Death for Christians that care about our country I don t think so They also caused 50 000 in damages in Bethesda Maryland setting fire to three churches It is shameful Jane s Revenge which is a terrorist group said If abortion isn t safe neither are you Mr. Speaker I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this resolution
392	Mr. Speaker I join my Democratic colleagues in opposing on the strongest terms all forms of political violence That is something that this resolution fails to do This resolution fails to acknowledge decades of well documented violence against reproductive healthcare providers in this country In failing to do so it fails us all I have seen that violence firsthand More than 30 years ago when I was a teenager I stood in defense of our local Planned Parenthood as anti abortion protesters tried to chain themselves to the doors to prevent women from going in not only to get abortion care but to get their Pap smears their birth control HIV tests and other services A few years later a well known anti abortion activist drove a van through the same door of that same Planned Parenthood Like I said I welcome the opportunity to vote on legislation that condemns all forms of political violence but the resolution s purposeful omission of abortion providers and patients and what that suggests is why I am voting no today and I urge my colleagues to do the same
393	Mr. Speaker I am against all forms of violence including violence against any one of the majority of Americans who support abortion rights The statistics are absolutely clear Since 1977 there have been 11 murders 42 bombings 196 arsons 491 assaults and thousands more illegal attacks on people who support abortion rights Let s include everyone in here when we talk about no more violence We have to make sure that people who are pro life and people who support abortion rights and we support life are included in opposing violence
394	Mr. Speaker as co chair of the Pro Choice Caucus I rise in opposition to H Con Res 3 Of course we condemn all political violence whether it is aimed at those we agree with or disagree with These acts are all unacceptable full stop Hate speech quickly becomes hate violence In a democracy violence is particularly awful when it is designed to silence or intimidate Where were my colleagues every single time a doctor a patient a nurse or a security officer was threatened assaulted or murdered just for providing accessing and safeguarding reproductive healthcare Congresswoman DeGette Congresswoman Pressley and I have drafted a resolution that condemns all attacks upon healthcare facilities healthcare personnel and patients Every act of hate fueled violence is worthy of condemnation including those against Planned Parenthood clinics abortion providers and patients and other care providers We stand with survivors of those attacks We condemn all of them and our GOP colleagues should do so as well
395	Mr. Speaker I rise today in support of H Con Res 3 which condemns the epidemic of attacks on pro life and faith based organizations Unfortunately Michigan s Fifth District has not escaped these attacks Last June Jane s Revenge vandals graffitied and smashed the windows of Jackson Michigan s Right to Life and my own office It was a despicable act The Jane s Revenge perpetrator who has yet to be caught even accidentally graffitied a neighbor s house as well Yet this darkness presented an opportunity to show the best of our community Volunteers from the community came out to clean up the broken glass and help board up the windows In contrast to this positivity displayed by everyday Americans and despite congressional efforts we have spearheaded President Biden s Justice Department has stayed silent on these acts of domestic terrorism Today congressional Democrats have an opportunity to right the wrongs of this administration and join us in condemning these acts of violence as we condemn all acts of violence as well Volunteers at pregnancy centers who remain committed to their convictions and efforts understand they have a target on their backs These volunteers are individuals spending their time and their money to clothe feed provide shelter and minister to women in crisis Is this the progressive America my colleagues talk about I think not Does their idea of progress consist of political violence targeting those who provide services to women and families Are intimidation and violence acceptable to the Biden administration and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle I hope not Mr. Speaker I strongly urge support for this resolution for the benefit of lives security and decency in our country
396	Mr. Speaker it is time for our Republican colleagues to stop playing politics with women s bodies With the fall of Roe the criminalization of abortion access nationwide with no exceptions is well underway Just last year in my home State of Florida Governor DeSantis signed a 15 week abortion ban into law that offers no exceptions for rape incest or human trafficking and more restrictive policies are coming Other States are even more restrictive and the bill and resolution before us will further erode women s reproductive rights These measures incentivize violence by failing to condemn a history of violence against abortion providers and patients While millions of Americans will lose under these measures its harshest impacts land on single working and women of color A lack of access to safe abortions not only deprives a woman of the basic right to control her own body but it also stifles her future economic educational and family planning opportunities It basically hands her body life and future over to the State These horrific anti abortion measures are a revolting assault on women s rights and I urge my colleagues to vote no on both measures
397	Mr. Speaker we heard the word shameful a lot during this debate but what is really shameful is the fact that my Democratic colleagues and I are willing to both say we condemn all violence and also put it on paper With my colleagues on the other side of the aisle all we hear is talk They are not willing to condemn all violence in this resolution It is a one sided resolution meant to fan the flames of anti abortion and anti freedom sentiment in this country See my district in central Florida sees these sentiments in action as our Governor has passed an abortion ban and looks to go even further As someone whose birth mother made the brave and difficult decision to put me up for adoption I recognize that that decision was deeply personal and can often mark one of the most vulnerable points in a person s life No one should take advantage of that and the Federal Government should actually protect it I will continue to fight for civil rights personal freedom and bodily autonomy of women and childbearing adults in this country and I hope the rest of this Chamber will join me in voting no
398	Mr. Speaker if my Republican colleagues want to condemn the growing level of political violence in this country let s do it together That is not what this resolution does What it does is it goes to great lengths to condemn attacks against anti choice groups and it says nothing about the growing threat of violence targeting women s health clinics across the United States It doesn t condemn the numerous bullets that have been fired at healthcare clinics throughout the country It doesn t condemn the bricks that have crashed through windows at providers offices or the assaults kidnappings and even the murders of doctors and healthcare personnel It doesn t condemn the arsons bombings death threats or any one of the more than 7 000 acts of violence that have been reported against these facilities By ignoring these acts of violence Republicans are sending a very dangerous message that will only embolden the extremists behind them Mr. Speaker I include in the Record a resolution that Congresswomen Lee and Pressley and I have introduced to condemn all acts of political violence regardless of their target or intent and I urge my colleagues to support it instead Whereas workplace violence ranges from threats and verbal abuse to physical assaults and homicide Whereas for decades health care personnel for women and people who access reproductive health care services have been subjected to intimidation threats and violence Whereas between 1977 and 2015 1 nearly 7 000 violent acts were reported against providers at health centers for women including bombings arsons death threats kidnappings and assaults and 2 more than 190 000 acts of disruption including bomb threats and harassing calls were reported Whereas between 1993 and 2015 there were 11 murders numerous attempted murders 42 bombings and 186 arsons targeted at individuals and facilities associated with care provided at health centers for women Whereas between 1993 and 2015 the 11 victims of anti choice violence include Dr David Gunn of Pensacola Florida in 1993 Dr John Bayard Britton and a volunteer James Barrett both of Pensacola Florida in 1994 clinic receptionists Shannon Lowney and Leanne Nichols both of Brookline Massachusetts in 1994 Dr Barnett Slepian of Buffalo New York in 1998 clinic securitv guard Robert Sanderson of Birmingham Alabama in 1998 Dr George Tiller of Wichita Kansas in 2009 and police officer Garrett Swasey Ke Arre Stewart and Jennifer Markovsky all of whom were lost during a violent attack at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs Colorado in 2015 Whereas in 2016 two defendants vandalized a Baltimore Maryland area abortion clinic on two separate occasions with one defendant pleading guilty and the other convicted at trial of Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances FACE Act violations Whereas in 2017 a defendant sent several threatening emails to abortion clinics located in Chicago Illinois and Hammond Indiana and the defendant pled guilty to FACE Act and other Federal offenses Whereas in 2018 a defendant directed a threatening social media post to Planned Parenthood facilities and staff and defendant pled guilty to Federal offenses including a FACE Act charge Whereas in 2019 a defendant was indicted for FACE Act violations and other Federal offenses related to a 2015 shooting at a Planned Parenthood facility in Colorado Springs Colorado where he shot at several civilians and police officers killing two civilians and one officer while injuring several others Whereas in 2020 a defendant pled guiltv to FACE Act related offenses in connection with a bomb threat call the defendant made to a Jacksonville Florida abortion clinic Whereas in 2021 a defendant pled guilty to a FACE Act violation and other State felony offenses for throwing a Molotov cocktail at a Fort Myers Florida abortion clinic Whereas in 2022 a defendant was indicted for FACE Act violations after he assaulted a Philadelphia Pennsylvania area Planned Parenthood clinic escort twice on the same date with one assault resulting in bodily injury and Whereas extreme rhetoric continues to fuel a hate filled climate that is dangerous for individuals who provide or access comprehensive health care services Now therefore be it Resolved That the House of Representatives 1 condemns all acts of political violence 2 condemns attacks on health care facilities health care personnel and patients 3 affirms that all people have the freedom to access reproductive health care services and medical advice without fear of violence intimidation or harassment and 4 calls upon the Biden administration to use all appropriate authorities to uphold public safety to protect health care facilities and safeguard health care personnel and patients
399	Mr. Speaker the resolved part of our resolution says this and I think all of my colleagues should be able to join this Resolved that the U S House of Representatives condemns all acts of political violence 2 condemns attacks on healthcare facilities healthcare personnel and patients and 3 affirms that all people have the freedom to access reproductive healthcare services and medical advice without fear of violence intimidation or harassment Isn t that what this is all about in this country fear from violence No violence everybody gets the healthcare services they want and they deserve without fear of being killed
400	Mr. Speaker I agree with my friend from Colorado that we should condemn all violence We should condemn violence to unborn children also but that doesn t seem to be something that is shared on the other side of aisle One of the pregnancy centers that was targeted last year was Life Choices Pregnancy Medical Center located in my home State and at the time in my district in Colorado On June 25 at 3 17 a m first responders responded to a fire at the pregnancy center The fire was the result of angry protestors acting out after the Supreme Court s Dobbs decision Not much was salvageable from the fire but what remained were hateful and extreme messages graffitied on the exterior of the building Kathy Roberts the executive director of Life Choices is here today to commemorate passage of this resolution I am honored to have Kathy here and to introduce this brave and dedicated woman I thank Kathy for being here Sadly our Nation has become all too familiar with the violent attacks on pro life centers In 2022 over 100 pro life centers were violently attacked and there has been minimal accountability Instead of Democrats accepting the Supreme Court Dobbs decision and condemning this violence they have egged it on including some who told pro abortion protestors to rise up and commended their violence by stating it was a way for individuals to channel their righteous anger into meaningful action Our Nation is a Nation of law and order and violence is never the path we should pursue to create effective change
401	Mr. Speaker as chair of the Abortion Rights and Access Task Force I rise to make plain exactly what is going on here This is not a debate about political violence Political violence and the violent rhetoric that drives it is a persistent threat my staff my family and I know that intimately Everyone should condemn it Our colleagues across the aisle continue to say the quiet part out loud in their selective contempt for political violence This resolution seeks to deny necessary medical care from those who seek it Abortion is healthcare and a fundamental human right Across the Nation those seeking care are met with intimidation violence and even loss of life Imagine walking through a screaming crowd to get to a medical appointment Imagine being a doctor or a nurse dedicating your life to helping others and day after day your workplace receives violent threats and you fear for your life But that is not what the other side of the aisle is concerned about No today they are seeking to mislead the American people They are trying to conjure up hateful rhetoric spreading misinformation about crisis pregnancy centers Let me make it plain Crisis pregnancy centers are no place to go for reproductive healthcare They are sham clinics that coerce folks seeking to terminate a pregnancy or to access the full range of reproductive health services
402	Mr. Speaker I thank my friend and colleague the chairman of the Judiciary Committee for his strong defense of life for the precious unborn and for promoting a culture of life at all times I stand Mr. Speaker in support of H Con Res 3 expressing the sense of Congress condemning the recent attacks on pro life facilities groups and churches There have been now nearly 100 recorded acts of violence and intimidation against pro life individuals and organizations by radical pro abortion activists since the initial leak of the draft Supreme Court Dobbs opinion Following the leak and issuance of the Supreme Court s decision in Dobbs v Jackson Women s Health Organization anti life fanatics have targeted destroyed or vandalized as I said over 100 pro life facilities groups and churches to further their radical cause Pro life pregnancy centers nationwide play a critical and important role in supporting and assisting pregnant women their children and their families Because the Biden Justice Department refuses to protect these vital resource centers Congress must be clear in condemning the violence against pro life facilities Mr. Speaker I urge all of my colleagues to stand against violence and to support H Con Res 3
403	Mr. Speaker I yield myself the balance of my time for closing Mr. Speaker if House Republicans were serious about condemning violence surrounding the debate on abortion the resolution would be clear in condemning all acts of violence lest we give tacit acquiescence to extremist anti abortion violence and against abortion providers This resolution does not do that at all Undoubtedly my Republican colleagues will attempt to portray any opposition to this partisan resolution as proof of Democrats so called extreme position on abortion but the American public is not so easily fooled They will recognize this resolution for what it is a transparent political exercise intended to lay the groundwork for MAGA Republicans plans for a total nationwide ban on abortion Mr. Speaker I urge all Members to vote no and I yield back the balance of my time
404	Mr. Speaker I yield myself the balance of my time for closing Mr. Speaker I just want to read what the resolution says That Congress condemns recent attacks over 100 of them in the last 7 months on pro life pregnancy centers and churches condemns recent attacks of vandalism violence and destruction against pro life facilities groups and churches Second it recognizes the sanctity of life the important role pro life facilities groups and churches play in supporting pregnant women infants and families Three it calls upon the Biden administration to use all appropriate law enforcement authorities to uphold public safety and protect the rights of pro life facilities groups and churches That is all it says This is as apple pie as it gets The hundreds of churches and crisis pregnancy centers that have been attacked in the last 7 months this resolution says Biden administration use the FACE Act which you have said applies not just to pro abortion clinics but also to pro life crisis pregnancy centers use that to make sure we can stop this stuff from happening in the future We condemn all violence every time it happens Here is what is interesting The violence that has been cited by the other side against abortion clinics and people associated with them guess what Those individuals were prosecuted and we support that What we want to know is why With over 100 attacks why hasn t the Justice Department to my knowledge used the FACE Act to prosecute anybody Why They say there is no political nature at the Justice Department now there is no weaponization Really Because it sure looks like there is a conflict here Sure looks like there is a double standard here This resolution is as basic as it gets Mr. Speaker I urge support hope this thing passes unanimously and I yield back the balance of my time
405	Mr. Speaker pursuant to House Resolution 5 I call up the bill H R 26 to amend title 18 United States Code to prohibit a health care practitioner from failing to exercise the proper degree of care in the case of a child who survives an abortion or attempted abortion and ask for its immediate consideration in the House

407	Mr. Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr. Speaker I rise in support of H R 26 the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act In simple terms Life is precious life is sacred all life including unborn children but that is not what this legislation is about This legislation is about those kids who are born alive making sure they get protected For over 40 years the decision in Roe v Wade as Justice Alito has stated inflamed debate and deepened division over the issue of abortion in this country We have seen that play out over the last year but what should be undisputed is the care of a child who is born alive after an attempted abortion Unfortunately as evidenced by comments from prominent Democrats not everyone believes that a child born alive should be protected We all know in 2019 then Governor Northam of the State of Virginia stated this The infant would be delivered the infant would be kept comfortable the infant would be resuscitated if that is what the mother and the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother Think about that It is not just anybody saying that It is the Governor of one of our largest States The cavalier attitude he displayed toward human life is just wrong H R 26 would require healthcare practitioners to give the same level of care to a child born alive after an abortion or an attempted abortion as the child at that same gestational age Work to save the kid s life work to help that newborn It would also require the immediate transfer of the surviving infant to a hospital This legislation requires healthcare practitioners or other employees to report any violations of this provision to State or Federal law enforcement for criminal prosecution In addition H R 26 provides the mother of an abortion survivor with a civil right of action against the healthcare practitioner who fails to provide the required level of care It is simple Infants born alive following an abortion are kids They are children All newborns deserve the same level of care In the Declaration of Independence our Founding Fathers declared that it was life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that are the unalienable rights bestowed on us by our Creator Congress has a duty to protect these fundamental rights This should be an easy vote for all Members I thank my colleagues Representatives Ann Wagner and Kat Cammack for their diligent work on this legislation and I urge all Members to support it Mr. Speaker I reserve the balance of my time
408	Mr. Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr. Speaker I rise in strong opposition to H R 26 the so called Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act Despite what its supporters would have us believe this legislation would do nothing to enhance protections or the quality of healthcare if an infant is born after an attempted abortion What it would do however is directly interfere with a doctor s medical judgment and dictate a medical standard of care that may not be appropriate in all circumstances which could in fact put infants lives at greater risk Finally by beginning this new Congress with a bill to restrict women s healthcare nationwide House Republicans have made clear that they will not stop until they reach their ultimate goal a nationwide ban on abortion It has always been the law that healthcare providers cannot deliberately harm newborn infants and that they must exercise reasonable care in their treatment of such infants The bill s implication that providers who perform abortions routinely act in a callous or a criminal manner that would result in an infant s death or that a provider who performs an abortion somehow cannot be trusted to take adequate measures to save a living baby s life is insulting and untrue In opposing this bill I do not oppose in any way proper medical treatment for newborn infants whatever the circumstances of their birth but determining the proper treatment is for medical professionals to decide not politicians in Congress When I supported the Born Alive Infants Protection Act in 2002 my reasoning and the reasoning of my pro choice colleagues was simple Killing an infant who is born alive either by an act of omission or commission is infanticide It was is and always should be against the law and we saw no harm in reaffirming that fact That law passed Congress with bipartisan support precisely because it was harmless even if it was also useless since it did not change the preexisting law in any way because after all murder is murder in every State The bill specifically just reiterated existing law in florid language and did nothing to interfere with doctors medical judgment or to cause needless harm Unfortunately the bill before us today puts children s lives and health at risk It requires doctors to immediately ensure transportation and admission of the infant to a hospital in all cases with no regard as to whether doing so is actually in the best interest of the child s health and well being This mandate effectively overrides the careful case by case exercise of professional medical judgment by healthcare providers and replaces it with a blanket rule enforceable with criminal penalties It may be after all in a given case that it is more beneficial to the infant s health to be treated on the spot and not rushed to a hospital immediately Such a ham fisted approach fails to consider the fact that in many cases it may be safer and more conducive to the infant s health to care for the infant where it was born rather than transporting it many miles away to a hospital This bill assumes that Congress knows better and it imposes a new obligation on providers that rather than saving lives puts infants at risk Perhaps if this bill had gone through regular order we could have avoided this unfortunate situation There has never been a committee markup or a hearing on this bill not in this Congress or in any previous Congress I would have welcomed the opportunity to hear from expert witnesses on best practices and standards of care for infants Members could have offered amendments and perfected the bill to ensure that it achieves our common goal of providing the best most medically appropriate care to infants and their mothers I am disappointed but not surprised that my colleagues rushed this bill to the floor when there is no evidence at all that doctors currently are failing to provide an appropriate level of care and when a chorus of provider groups oppose this bill Sadly rather than protecting infants my Republican colleagues are putting them at greater risk in the service of politics Indeed by bringing this bill straight to the floor as one of the first measures to be considered by the 118th Congress Republicans and the most extreme elements of the anti abortion movement have signaled their determination to enact a nationwide ban on abortion I cannot support H R 26 because it mandates a particular course of treatment the immediate transport to a hospital which may not be appropriate and may be medically dangerous in certain cases In doing so it abandons the practice of considering the best medical interest of infants and their mothers Republicans have made clear where they stand about a woman s right to control her body Make no mistake This bill is another step in their plan to criminalize abortion nationwide Mr. Speaker I urge my colleagues to reject this ill conceived legislation and I reserve the balance of my time
409	Mr. Speaker I point out this bill has passed multiple times in previous Congresses the exact same language and it has passed with bipartisan support Mr. Speaker I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from the State of Missouri Mrs Wagner the sponsor of the legislation who has worked tirelessly on this good piece of legislation
410	Mr. Speaker I thank my good friend and colleague a champion for life our chair of the Judiciary Committee Jim Jordan I rise today Mr. Speaker in support of H R 26 the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act I have championed this issue for decades and I have been blessed and honored to lead this legislation since 2019 I am so grateful to the co leads of this bill Representative Kat Cammack and our Majority Leader Steve Scalise to the leadership of this Congress and especially to the thousands of champions of life across the country for their tireless work and support of the most vulnerable Americans unborn and newborn infants Thanks to these efforts after dozens of unanimous consent requests two discharge petitions and countless hours of advocacy work the House will at last take action to ensure that every single baby born in the United States receives lifesaving medical care at their most vulnerable moment All children should be welcomed with joy and wonder no matter the circumstances of their birth Yet too many of these sweet little ones are denied the medical care they need to survive and thrive simply because they were unwanted This commonsense legislation will require healthcare providers to administer the same level of care to the babies who survive abortions that they would to any other child born at the same gestational age I hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will again join me in supporting the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act as some did as our chairman mentioned when it passed the House in both 2015 and 2018 with bipartisan support To that point I want to be absolutely clear that this bill has nothing to do with the Supreme Court s decision in Dobbs to return abortion to the States Not a word of the born alive act obstructs States ability to implement Dobbs as they see fit I strongly believe that States should control pro life policymaking just as I support exceptions for rape incest and the life of the mother but today we are considering an entirely separate issue We are considering the protection of infants that have been delivered alive after an attempted abortion That is it plain and simple I implore my Democratic colleagues to put aside politics and stand in support of lifesaving care for these innocent newborns We must remember today that children are not the only victims of born alive abortions Women fathers and whole families all suffer deeply from the loss of a child Our communities are weaker because these bright young ones did not grow up to share their wisdom laughter and ingenuity with all of us Just down the hall a little bit later this afternoon we will meet with extraordinary women who survived abortions When they entered the world they were not greeted with the profound love and all that I felt when I held my children and grandchildren for the first time Instead they were left to die They are alive today because of courage and grace mostly of nurses who chose to act as they struggled for breath Each of these women has built a happy healthy life bringing light and joy to their friends and families and enriching their communities They inspire us all As a mother and grandmother they affirm my belief in a culture of life for children born and unborn and their mothers and families Every single newborn regardless of the circumstances of their birth deserves to share the miracle of life and have lifesaving medical care We must act with compassion to protect these little ones and give women a strong support system as they navigate the miracles and challenges of motherhood This bill will save real lives and it will give survivors a precious chance to build a future Mr. Speaker I urge every Member of the House to vote yes on H R 26 the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act
411	Mr. Speaker I thank the distinguished gentleman from New York for yielding and all my colleagues for their continued leadership on this incredibly important issue The 118th Congress has begun and the differences between our side of the aisle and the other side of the aisle couldn t be any clearer Let me of course reiterate that as Democrats we look forward to trying to find common ground whenever and wherever possible to solve issues of consequence on behalf of the American people but we will oppose extremism whenever it rears its ugly head Democrats have made clear that we are going to continue to work on issues like lowering costs better paying jobs safer communities defending democracy protecting the public interest ensuring economic opportunity in every single ZIP Code and yes fighting for reproductive freedom My Republican colleagues you promised to come to Washington to fight for the American people but have spent a lot of time fighting each other on politics power and personality not working on issues related to the public interest That is what the last few days have indicated an extreme MAGA Republican agenda Now that you are getting into substance on Monday you passed a bill designed to allow the wealthy the well off and the well connected to cheat on their taxes subsidize the lifestyles of the rich and shameless benefit millionaires and billionaires not working class families not middle class families not low income families not veterans not everyday Americans the wealthy the well off and the well connected That was on Monday Then on Tuesday you came to the floor and passed a select committee on insurrection protection a committee that is clearly designed in the words of some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to obstruct justice as part of your evident desire as many of you have said to eventually defund the FBI That was Tuesday Now on Wednesday you come to the floor with nothing on inflation nothing on quality of life issues for the American people nothing even on public safety You come to the floor as part of your march to criminalize abortion care to impose a nationwide ban to set into motion government mandated pregnancies That is the distinction for today As Democrats we believe in a woman s freedom to make her own reproductive healthcare decisions period full stop decisions that should be between a woman her family and her doctors period full stop We believe in Roe v Wade Do you wonder about our position That is it The Women s Health Protection Act that is it Freedom to make your own reproductive healthcare decisions that is it As compared to a clear effort that is what this bill is about today a march toward criminalizing abortion care a nationwide ban government mandated pregnancies part of an extreme MAGA Republican agenda So yes we continue to extend our hand of partnership if you truly want to work on quality of life issues but we haven t seen it We haven t seen it on Monday we haven t seen it on Tuesday and we are not seeing it today Mr. Speaker we oppose this bill We oppose an extreme MAGA Republican agenda Let s get back to the business of the American people
412	Mr. Speaker I would point out the minority leader said their position is Roe v Wade Their position is real simple and it is real radical Their position is you should be able to take the life of an unborn child right up until their birthday and then as Governor Northam has said even after their birthday That is what this bill seeks to stop and to make sure that it doesn t happen That is as radical as you can get taking the life of unborn children right up to their birth day And then as Governor Northam pointed out even after that We want to make sure that even after that part never happens because we believe life is precious and life is sacred Mr. Speaker I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida Mrs Cammack one of the cosponsors of this legislation
413	Mr. Speaker I rise today in strong support of H R 26 the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act This bill does exactly what the title says which in this town is a novel concept Mr. Speaker I thank my colleague Ann Wagner for her tireless efforts I thank our majority leader Steve Scalise for his efforts on this issue And of course I thank Chairman Jim Jordan of the Judiciary Committee for being such an advocate for the pro life community Today we are not talking about abortion We are talking about children We are talking about children who have been born and are fighting to survive despite an abortion attempt In some cases when a woman receives a late term abortion the baby can be born alive following the procedure Federal law currently recognizes these babies as persons but fails to outline any requirements of care after the infant is born alive H R 26 would rectify this by requiring healthcare practitioners to treat any child born alive after an abortion as they would any infant and requires that the infant be immediately treated with lifesaving care and transported to a hospital I honestly do not understand what is so controversial about that Mr. Speaker this bill establishes criminal penalties for any healthcare practitioner or abortion clinic employee who fails to comply with the requirements established by this bill because let s face it no one can deny that a child who survives an abortion attempt who is outside the womb breathing and struggling for life despite all attempts to end it doesn t deserve equal protection under the law Under our law murder is illegal That shouldn t be a controversial position Eight babies in Florida alone just last year eight babies were reported to have been born alive during an abortion attempt The stories are horrific One that sticks out in particular was an NBC report in 2006 They told the story of a 23 week old baby boy that was born alive at an abortion clinic in Hialeah Florida When he began breathing and moving the abortion clinic owner Belkis Gonzalez reportedly cut the umbilical cord and zipped him into a biohazard bag where he then died It is hard to read those words But as has been stated here on this floor in this Chamber this isn t about pro life versus pro choice This is about protecting those most vulnerable It is about who we are as a society who we are as a people and who we are as Americans I hope that both sides of this Chamber can agree that accountability is a good thing Protecting these children is a good thing It is time to put the party politics aside and the talking points aside and give these children wanted or unwanted a fighting chance a chance that they all deserve
414	Mr. Speaker it is a crime now to kill a child born alive In fact in May of 2013 a Philadelphia man was convicted of first degree murder in the killing of three infants He is now serving life without parole Either my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are unaware of this already existing crime with a penalty of life without parole or this is another extreme political stunt Let me be clear Abortion care is healthcare and that has been true for a very long time My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are not interested in medical truths No Instead they are interested in scaring people outlawing all abortions and criminalizing anyone they can Politicians have no business making unsound medical decisions We are legislators not doctors In the unfortunate case when a child is born with fatal disabilities this legislation will deny parents a say in how their child spends the final minutes hours or days of his or her life whether hooked up to a medical device or in the arms of their parents Expectant parents have enough worries They should not have to worry about extreme politicians in their doctor s office or hospital thinking they somehow know better Mr. Speaker I urge my colleagues to vote no on H R 26
415	Mr. Speaker I was a corpsman that is a combat medic in the Navy SEAL teams for over 20 years and I would like to give you a different perspective If I were to encounter an enemy combatant on the battlefield who was wounded which I have I was obligated by international law to render medical care to that enemy combatant to the best of my ability up to and including to the detriment of my own troops or I would be subject to prosecution I find it absurd I find it unconscionable that this would be a matter of discussion in this body that we would not render medical aid to the most innocent amongst us an unborn child that is born alive after the most traumatic circumstances possible Mr. Speaker I would implore my Democratic colleagues to remember that this is not about a woman s access to abortion This is about the sanctity of life and the basic dignity of a human child
416	Mr. Speaker I rise today to oppose this grotesque attempt to politicize abortion care and criminalize doctors Politicians should not be in the business of mandating that women carry dangerous or unwanted pregnancies to term They should stay out of the doctor s office when Americans are exercising their fundamental right to decide when or if to have children But rightwing extremists have made it their first order of business in this new Congress to attack abortion rights and spread disinformation This bill is deliberately misleading It is harmful to both people facing pregnancy complications and to the doctors who provide their care If passed it would cause more maternal deaths in this country which are already a national shame Congress has a responsibility to legislate honestly and this bill is not honest The American people deserve better than having Congress waste time on political stunts pretending to fix problems that do not exist Americans don t want MAGA extremists to criminalize women s healthcare and they don t want politicians in their doctor s offices
417	Mr. Speaker I appreciate my friend Chairman Jordan yielding to me I thank my friend Representative Ann Wagner for introducing this important bill again no better person than a mama and a grandmama and she does a good job at both of those Mr. Speaker babies deserve a chance to live They deserve a chance at life no matter their age or their circumstance The Constitution says that people have a right to life The science says babies are people The Democrats have been pushing trust the science Follow the science Trust the science Follow the science the last 2 years Yet we are denying the science Mr. Speaker When I was a little boy I was asking my mama we were talking about abortion and we were talking about babies being born that were maybe disabled or had some other anomaly and I said Mama what would we do if one of those babies was born and I was the father of one of those little babies And she said Honey we would love that baby just a little more Mr. Speaker we need to love those babies just a little more and not murder them
418	Mr. Speaker I rise in strong opposition to the latest attempt by House Republicans to control women s reproductive freedom a ruse to ban safe and legal abortions in this country This legislation purports to address something that does not happen The hypotheticals some of my colleagues described are not based in fact Their arguments are untrue and do not represent how medicine actually works Their suggestions are not only false but they are callous The truth is abortions that occur after 3 months of pregnancy account for only 1 percent of all abortions and they occur almost exclusively because a woman s life is at risk or her pregnancy is not viable We should not be in the business of enacting laws that make these difficult and painful situations worse What is not hypothetical is the real pain and suffering that politicians across this country are imposing as they continue to chip away at what should be an essential right A woman must have the right to make health decisions that are in the best of interest of themselves their family and their circumstances Mr. Speaker I urge my colleagues to oppose this sham piece of legislation
419	Mr. Speaker I thank the chairman for yielding It sounds really good to call him Mr Chairman He is going to do a great job for us and the American people more importantly Mr. Speaker I rise today in support of H R 26 the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act Since my first year in office I have shown a strong commitment to promoting a culture of life The bill before us requires practitioners who are present for an attempted abortion resulting in a live birth to exercise the same degree of care that would be offered to any other child born of that gestational age After those efforts the healthcare workers must admit the child to a hospital This bill also gives mothers a civil cause of action and protection from any prosecution recognizing that women are the second victims of abortion and attempted abortions Mr. Speaker I urge all my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation because surely we can all agree that a child born alive has a right to live
420	Mr. Speaker I would say Here we go again For those of us who have served in the United States Congress this is Here we go again This is legislation that is attempting to be wrapped in mercy that is without mercy First of all it is without fact It is extremely important to know that if you were here in the United States Congress you know the history because we have already passed the bipartisan Born Alive Infants Protection Act which reiterates the fact that it is illegal to interfere with a newborn They are protected from both intentional harm by healthcare providers and harm from medical negligence plain and simple period at the end of the sentence Why are we here today We are here today for news clips We are here today for quotes and condemnation of the other side of the aisle that wants to be reckless with the life of a child I can assure you Mr. Speaker that those of us who have given birth and those of us who have lost in the birth process are extreme lovers of those wonderful opportunities of life I refuse and reject condemnation of my personal self because I believe these decisions are with a God the woman s God and the families God her faith doctors and of course the persons who are a part of the medical profession I have article after article that talks about the tragedy of partial birth abortion which is the name used more than a decade ago They always find creative names to be able to be criminalized We heard from a member of the Rules Committee who said How dare you grab up a child put them in an ambulance and take them hundreds of miles away from their family Or maybe the family who found out that the multiple abnormalities of their child would not allow them to live and they had waited 8 years for this wonderful baby The decisions unfortunately of neither life nor death come easily for these children There is a painful existence marked by periods of breathing cessation and seizures when they are born Because my OB was unable to get a good image of the brain until the 13th week we understand that these are personal decisions We understand that these are painful decisions So I stand with those families I refuse to condemn those families and I refuse to be merciless I am giving mercy in voting against this legislation I am voting against it now Mr. Speaker I rise in strong opposition to H R 26 the BornAlive Abortion Survivors Protection Act which would establish requirements for the degree of care a health care practitioner must provide in the case of a child born alive following an abortion or attempted abortion In the first week of the 118th Congress extreme MAGA Republicans are launching attacks on reproductive freedom intruding on medical decision making and keeping their promise to criminalize abortion nationwide with no exceptions H R 26 is a clear attack on health care providers and attempts to evoke power over the care that they provide to patients When the Senate attempted to pass this bill in 2019 17 medical and public health organizations sent a letter in strong opposition to the bill stating that it represented a dangerous government intrusion into private health care decisions This bill undermines medical professionals training and critical judgment minimizing their ability to determine the best medical treatment for their patients Medical professionals abide by a Code of Ethics during their career For lawmakers to undermine the work of medical professionals and attempt to prosecute them for doing what is right for their patients is inappropriate and misdirected This bill is a direct way to compromise the health and safety of patients A 2015 study published by the New England Journal of Medicine states that a baby s viability is the determining factor in the care that they receive The study states that active intervention for infants born before 22 weeks gestation is generally not recommended whereas the approach for infants born at or after 22 weeks of gestation varies Seeing that there are already standards in place to determine level of care why should we as lawmakers intervene to override what medical professionals agree is the most appropriate medical treatment warranted by the circumstances To suggest that medical professionals would not provide equal and adequate medical attention to all patients is thoughtless insulting and uncivil For a party that advocated for minimal federal government interference and big government Republicans are attempting to increase the federal government s jurisdiction over local governments Why should we as lawmakers seek to prosecute medical professionals that are simply doing their job This bill would force medical professionals to worry about criminal penalties and legislative interpretation when the appropriate medical care is already laid out This bill would remove a medical professional s ability to make the medically sound decision for their patient without government interference and the threat of repercussions This bill endangers infants because it puts Republican wishes ahead of appropriate medical care H R 26 Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act is dangerous to both medical professionals and patients Medical professionals would be placed under unnecessary scrutiny when legislation and protocols are already in place for this situation I encourage my colleagues to join me in opposing this bill that would establish requirements for the degree of care a health care practitioner must provide in the case of a child born alive following an abortion or attempted abortion Mr Speaker I include in the Record a statement written by Audrey Eisen titled How The Abortion Ban Debate Became My Story From ACLU Feb 2 2009 How the Abortion Ban Debate Became My Story By Audrey Eisen I never thought that so called partial birth abortion would ever have anything to do with me Why would it I m 34 years old and I desperately want children My husband and I have been together for eight years married for four and trying to have a baby for two Abortion was not something I thought much about But earlier this year all that changed In November of 2002 after fighting infertility and experiencing the sadness of a miscarriage in July we were thrilled to find ourselves pregnant again While still apprehensive we consciously decided to be excited another loss would hurt just the same regardless of whether or not we had allowed ourselves to be happy In the first few months my endocrinologist performed regular ultrasounds to ensure that the embryo was developing normally It was such a treat to be able to see our child growing I kept the pictures and my thoughts in a pregnancy journal When it became evident that we were going to make it through the first trimester my endocrinologist referred me to an obstetrician OB At my first appointment the nurse put a fetal heart monitor on my belly and much to our amazement from a seemingly great distance we heard the characteristic whoosh of our child s heartbeat We were on top of the world thinking that for sure this one was going to make it At 13 weeks however all this changed abruptly when during a routine ultrasound exam my OB discovered our child had polydactyly more than the normal number of digits While at first we thought it was just the hands we later learned that the feet were affected as well At the time my husband and I thought it was no big deal we had both known people with an extra finger and we were prepared to help our child live with the condition However we soon found out that an extra toe or finger were the least of our concerns polydactyly is associated with over 100 syndromes most commonly Trisomy 13 Trisomy 13 is characterized by multiple abnormalities many of which are not compatible with life beyond a couple of months Most fetuses with Trisomy 13 die in utero of those who make it to birth almost half do not survive past the first month roughly three quarters die within 6 months Long term survival is one year Unfortunately neither life nor death come easily for these children theirs is a painful existence marked by periods of breathing cessation and seizures Because my OB was unable to get a good image of the brain during the 13th week ultrasound we returned at 15 weeks The first thing my OB examined during this visit was the fetal brain He didn t say a word I could tell he was holding something back and asked that he tell me what he saw He said It is not normal The rest of the scan was a blur as tears ran down my cheeks and those of my mother and husband who had accompanied me to the doctor s office that day Following the scan the doctor left us alone to compose ourselves I cried with my whole body from the depths of my soul Shortly thereafter I had other tests These confirmed that our baby had Trisomy 13 At this point we discussed our options with a genetic counselor My husband and I both felt strongly that we did not want our child to suffer we decided to terminate the pregnancy as soon as possible I had an abortion on the first day of my 16th week of pregnancy Soon after I had the procedure I began to see news stories about a new federal partial birth abortion ban Like many Americans following the press on this issue over the past several years I had thought My God this must be something horrible But as I mourned the loss of my much desired pregnancy I came to realize that if such legislation passed the right to safe second trimester abortions like the one I had might not remain available to those women who come after me While proponents of this ban claim that it is aimed at one procedure performed late in pregnancy the reality is that it would prohibit the safest and most common procedures used in the second trimester well before fetal viability Without access to this care I don t know how women will endure if after routine prenatal testing they discover as we did that their fetuses suffer from grave conditions incompatible with life I don t know how I would have endured Two weeks following my abortion we received a letter from the genetic counselor Our child had numerous abnormalities the brain heart and other internal organs were not developing properly Our child was also a girl and we miss her very much In our case abortion was the only humane choice This choice must be preserved for the sake of all women and their families The American public needs to understand the consequences of this ban and that the human face of so called partial birth abortion my face could be their own
421	Mr. Speaker I rise today in support of H R 26 I thank my colleague the chair of the Judiciary Committee from Ohio for yielding me time Mr. Speaker as a mother a doctor a former nurse and a former director of Iowa s Department of Public Health I know firsthand the preciousness of life and the importance of prenatal care and the tragedies that ensue when proper care isn t provided In fact the first healthy baby I delivered as a doctor was to a young teenager who put the baby up for adoption Our Nation promises three things life liberty and the pursuit of happiness There is no clause in the Constitution to exempt newborns who survive an abortion procedure from these rights It is not only unreasonable but it is inhuman to deny care to babies who were born alive Regardless of maternal intent what could be more extreme than denying care to an infant born alive My colleague on the other side of the aisle from New York is correct It is infanticide H R 26 is legislation that should receive wide support from both sides of the aisle It is unconscionable to think that some Members will choose to vote against this bill which will ensure infants receive lifesaving care simply because of partisan politics This legislation isn t about abortions but saving the lives of living and breathing innocent newborns Many States including Iowa have put safe haven laws in place to allow parents to leave their infants at hospitals or care facilities without fear of being prosecuted We already have laws in place to protect these infants Why should infants who survive an abortion be treated any differently Like all other medical professionals I took the Hippocratic oath which promises that I will do no harm This legislation reaffirms the Hippocratic oath and ensures that doctors across the United States are providing the same standard of medical care to all infants regardless of the circumstance of their birth Mr. Speaker I urge all of my colleagues to stand in support of life by voting for H R 26
422	My my my Here we go again Republicans are racing full steam ahead to criminalize abortion nationwide Mr. Speaker the American people want women not politicians to make their own healthcare decisions including those about abortion So as to this misleading and offensively named bill let s vote it down Let s say no to putting women s lives in danger no to denying patients needing lifesaving care and no to putting healthcare providers in prison for doing their job Mr. Speaker because I love my grandchildren I reject the extreme Republican agenda and I am standing here today with the Democrats for people to have the freedom to make their own personal decisions about their health their life and their future
423	Mr. Speaker I thank the gentleman from Ohio for yielding Mr. Speaker I especially thank the gentlewoman from Missouri Ann Wagner for leading this effort for so many years I am so proud to rise in support of this bill that is about human dignity and frankly it is about common sense The idea Mr. Speaker that if a baby is born alive outside the womb that that baby in America could be killed and it be called abortion and not murder defies logic It defies humanity Over the years Kat Cammack has had a discharge petition to bring this bill to the floor So many others all across the country have asked Congress to address this issue and the first thing that people express is shock They say Wait a minute If a baby is born outside the womb alive how could you then kill that baby and that be legal How is that not already murder I questioned how it wasn t myself and yet in a number of States it is legal and it is happening today This is America Mr. Speaker you see this in countries like China and North Korea There aren t many countries in the world that allow this practice The United States should not be one of those countries This is inhumane This transcends the abortion debate Before the Dobbs decision this bill still would have been constitutional to pass because we are not talking about 20 weeks we are talking about the baby born alive outside the womb Yet in America there are some States that allow that baby to be killed and called abortion You can call it whatever you want Mr. Speaker It should be murder It shouldn t be allowed and this bill takes care of that Everybody should vote for this bill When you talk to people who identify as pro choice so many of them are shocked that this is a legal process Some obviously still want it to continue but we shouldn t We should be better than that as a country There is an amazing group called the Abortion Survivors Network Ann Wagner and I and so many of us have surely met with some of these incredible people If you want to talk about a walking miracle Mr. Speaker these are people alive today in their twenties thirties and forties living incredible lives who were the result of an abortion that wasn t successful They lived through it Think of the special plan God has for them that they survived an abortion and they are alive today They are incredible people Everybody in this country should reach out and go meet them It is a group and you can look them up Their stories are incredible Why should they be denied life We are a country of laws We are a country of great rights Of our inalienable rights life liberty and the pursuit of happiness the first among those is life Very few countries in the world allow this to happen to someone if they are born alive So while they are shocked when people find out that it is legal we are the United States Congress we can actually do something about it Thank God we have people who are willing to stand up for those babies I am not even talking about inside the womb They are outside the womb born alive If someone takes their life after they are born alive outside the womb that should be murder We should be protecting those young babies That is what this bill does It is a bill we should all be proud to support It is a list that the United States should want to take itself off of We shouldn t want to be associated with the very few countries that allow this barbaric process to happen Let s pass this bill Let s become an even more perfect Union
424	Mr. Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr. Speaker Mr Scalise and every other Republican who has spoken on this bill is simply wrong on the facts It is illegal and always has been illegal in every State and then Federal law to kill an infant born alive It is illegal and always has been illegal not to provide that infant with appropriate medical care Just to make sure that no one had any doubts of that we passed the Born Alive Infants Protection Act with bipartisan support in 2002 The problem with this bill is not that it provides any new protections for infants The problem with this bill is that it endangers some infants by stating that that infant must immediately be brought to the hospital where depending on the circumstances that may be the right thing to do for the health and survival of that infant or it may not That is the problem with this bill It directs and mandates a certain medical care which may not be appropriate and which may even endanger the life of an infant in certain circumstances That is why we oppose this bill It is not because we don t think that babies born alive must be saved but because we do think that babies born alive must be saved Mr. Speaker I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentlewoman from Oregon Ms Bonamici
425	Mr. Speaker this bill is extremist dangerous and unnecessary It is extremist because it would criminalize doctors with up to 5 years in prison and put them in fear of providing lifesaving medically necessary procedures to those who are pregnant It is dangerous because the bill has no exceptions to protect the health of the patient and no exceptions in cases where there is a serious fetal anomaly It is unnecessary because as Mr Nadler said it is already a crime to kill a baby born alive Many of my Republican colleagues talk about keeping Big Government out of people s lives But when it comes to the hardest and most intimate decision decisions that should be made between patients and their healthcare providers these same colleagues think the government knows better Republicans in Congress and conservative extremists on the Supreme Court are waging a war on reproductive healthcare a war on bodily autonomy and a war on the medical community and the doctor patient relationship I will continue to stand up against these assaults on reproductive freedom and against extremist dangerous unnecessary and misguided policies like this bill
426	Mr. Speaker I rise in opposition to H R 26 and to its very name because it is not about what House Republicans claim it is about because what they claim it is about isn t a thing What this bill is about is an assault on the health rights equality and dignity of American women and the people who provide their reproductive healthcare It is an assault we have seen in my home State of Texas where women having miscarriages are being turned away from the hospitals and told to come back when they are closer to dying where doctors fear and are told that they cannot meet the standard of care for their patients Providers and patients are afraid of misleading bills like this one criminalizing healthcare But of course that is the point isn t it I stand here today and I will stand here every day to oppose this bill and others like it to talk about the real healthcare crisis facing women today and to urge my colleagues to vote no
427	Mr. Speaker H R 26 would rob families of the ability to make difficult and complicated medical decisions in some of the most heartbreaking circumstances imaginable It is a mean spirited solution in search of a problem If the majority is interested in caring for newborns I invite them to support Democrats efforts to provide paid family leave to every new parent Republicans are welcome to join our efforts to expand the child tax credit to families struggling with paying the bills And we would be thrilled to have bipartisan support in this Chamber to make childcare affordable everywhere Alternatively House Republicans have brought up a bill designed to intimidate doctors and perpetuate disinformation about how abortion care actually works Mr. Speaker I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill and instead vote yes on the motion to recommit which would bring up my bill the Women s Health Protection Act legislation that would create a Federal right to abortion care free from medically unnecessary restrictions in all 50 States
428	Mr. Speaker I thank my friend and colleague the chairman of the Judiciary Committee for yielding As I have said before and will continue to say I am pro life pro family and pro child I am very proud to see that one of the very first pieces of legislation that comes before this Congress and the new majority is protecting the vulnerable That is something I have always stood up for since my first time here in Congress It seems like there is some confusion especially on the other side of the aisle Mr. Speaker about what this legislation is about This legislation is very simple It simply states and ensures that babies who survive an abortion receive care and protection and that they are not discarded because someone else had intended to end their lives It prohibits healthcare practitioners from turning a blind eye to abortion survivors No matter the intent of what you believe about life failure to care for an unborn child is infanticide and the law must be enforced Mr. Speaker I ask my colleagues to remember that the last time we voted on this bill there was bipartisan support and I ask again for support of this commonsense lifesaving legislation
429	Mr. Speaker born alive has nothing to do with abortion Providers are already required by law to provide appropriate medical care Infanticide is murder What we heard earlier is just not true It is a lie that should not be repeated As our chairman has said not only is it illegal to not care for a born infant but the law that you have provided on the Republican side actually can create more harm It requires immediately taking a struggling baby to a hospital That hospital could be hours away and could be detrimental to the life of that baby This is nothing more than a part of the effort to make abortion illegal nationally in this country I object and I urge a no vote
430	Mr. Speaker I rise today in support of the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act From New Albany to Salem to Madison Hoosiers across southern Indiana feel as I do that every life is precious and all lives deserve the dignity and respect of lifesaving care That is why I am proud to stand alongside my colleagues in support of this pro life bill This legislation would ensure that children who are born alive despite an attempted abortion are given the same medical care and help as any other newborn infant We know the majority of Americans agree on this issue that saving the lives of babies who survive a botched abortion is not just humane but it is necessary and foundational to our constitutional right to life It is why I am an original cosponsor on this important bill to support mothers and their children I stand with Hoosiers on behalf of these vulnerable infants Unfortunately Mr. Speaker Democrats support the radical position of abortion on demand up until birth funded by the taxpayers and they would even deny care to an innocent child that miraculously survives a botched abortion This is a commonsense support of life Mr. Speaker I urge the rest of my colleagues to stand with us in defending life On this issue we should all agree
431	Mr. Speaker I rise today to talk about freedom specifically individual freedom a core American value a value that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have for years co opted weaponized and distorted I simply do not understand how my Republican colleagues can demand the individual freedom to spread a deadly disease to other people by not getting vaccinated or wearing masks yet have the gall to deny the individual freedom to make decisions about one s own body that has no impact on anyone else How can it be that autonomy to wear a mask or not is of greater importance than the autonomy over whether to have a baby or not Let me say it plainly We cannot talk about preserving our individual freedoms while simultaneously ripping away a fundamental freedom for women in this country Control over one s reproductive health is a human right We are in the first week of Congress and what are we focused on Is it to fight inflation No To create jobs for Americans No To protect children from gun violence No It is to continue the assault on our autonomy on women s autonomy
432	Mr. Speaker I thank my good friend for yielding and I thank Ann Wagner for authoring this important legislation Mr. Speaker in a Florida abortion clinic Sycloria Williams delivered a live baby girl at 23 weeks The clinic owner took the baby who was gasping for air cut her umbilical cord threw her into a biohazard bag and put the bag in the trash Heartbroken Ms Williams later had a funeral for her baby girl who she named Shanice CNN has reported since that Ms Williams suffers PTSD from that ordeal Mr. Speaker why are these live births from abortion little known Dr Willard Cates former head of the Centers for Disease Control s abortion surveillance unit said several years ago live births are little known because organized medicine from fear of public clamor and legal action treats them more as an embarrassment to be hushed up than a problem to be solved It is like turning yourself in to the IRS for an audit he went on What is there to gain The tendency is not to report because there are only negative incentives Mr. Speaker Philadelphia abortionist Kermit Gosnell one of the few who got caught and it was under a State law not Federal and many States don t have such laws was convicted of murder for killing children who were born alive after attempted abortions The grand jury report described it in this way Gosnell had a simple solution for the unwanted babies he delivered He killed them He didn t call it that He called it ensuring fetal demise The way he ensured fetal demise was by sticking scissors into the back of the baby s neck and cutting the spinal cord He called that snipping The Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act seeks to end or at least mitigate this egregious child abuse by requiring that a healthcare provider must exercise the same degree of professional skill care and diligence to preserve the life of that child as they would a child of similar age The bill empowers the woman upon whom the abortion is performed to obtain appropriate civil relief I am sure had it been available then Ms Williams would have done that as well Mr. Speaker this is humane pro child human rights legislation
433	Mr. Speaker I rise in opposition to H R 26 H R 26 is presented within the context of what happened last year when the Supreme Court stripped millions of women in our country of their status and free right for equal access to reproductive freedom As Members of Congress we have a responsibility to correct this wrong and bring back reproductive freedom for women This bill is not about the safety of children This is more of the same This is about policing the bodies of women A bunch of middle aged guys in Brooks Brothers suits stand here today and try to tell women what to do with their bodies That is what this is about This is not about the safety of children That is already illegal Mr. Speaker I stand here to oppose H R 26 There are 64 million women across America of reproductive age Many of them live in States that are beating up on their rights to reproductive freedom Mr. Speaker I stand here in opposition to H R 26 and ask my colleagues also to vote against it
434	Mr. Speaker once again we have to say How did we get to where we are today How did we get to where we have to have a debate to defend life that survives the heinous practice of abortion In the infamous words of the Governor of my very State the Commonwealth of Virginia just a few years ago if a baby survives an abortion attempt the mother and the doctor would have a conversation while they kept the baby comfortable to decide what to do with it He said that on air in a radio broadcast I realize that the other side may not recognize the science of conception I realize that the other side may not share the premium or the value of innocent life in the womb that most Americans have The party of death that believes in abortion up until the moment of birth at any time for any reason today we find ourselves even having to defend and protect life a baby that survives an abortion attempt If it were not so if it were not true then this bill should pass unanimously I fear that will not be the case for this same party will not even vote later today against and condemn the violence at pregnancy centers across the country Mr. Speaker I encourage everyone to support this bill and protect all life
435	Mr. Speaker I rise in opposition to H R 26 We didn t hop in a time machine back to the 1970s It is 2023 and we all know what this is about It is not about the protection of newborn children It is about control It is about Republicans continued desire to control women take away their freedoms limit their bodily autonomy plunge poor women deeper into poverty and further marginalize those already not seen It is about intimidating silencing and criminalizing doctors It is about the nationwide abortion ban that Republicans have been itching to enact since the overturning of Roe v Wade bans that the American people have said loudly and clearly that they do not want We cannot continue to let the extreme Republican Party attack and erode the rights of women across this country We have a responsibility to put an end to politicians inserting themselves into the doctors offices and uteruses of women across this country Mr. Speaker I urge my colleagues to vote against this measure
436	Mr. Speaker I rise in support of the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act Once again House Republicans are eager to stand for the most vulnerable among us the unborn We are the party of life and we are proud of it There is no difference between an infant born alive after a failed abortion and an infant born into the arms of loving parents Those two babies deserve to be treated with the same level of excellent medical care Yet abortionists have demonstrated a lack of interest in preserving the lives of babies who enter the world alive and supposedly under their care We know what happens in these clinics By way of just one example lifenews com reports that an abortion provider in Minnesota was recently asked by a woman 22 weeks pregnant and considering an abortion what that provider would do if her baby were taken out while his heart was still beating The abortion provider responded We don t tell women this but if we was to proceed with the abortion and the baby was to come out still alive most likely we will break the baby s neck That is chilling and barbaric but our Democratic colleagues will not admit that They will vote against it today Watch the board It will be shocking and it will be true The Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act would make it a Federal crime for abortionists to kill or fail to provide care to babies who survive abortions Mr. Speaker I encourage all of our colleagues to support this critical legislation As was said it should pass unanimously but it won t
437	Mr. Speaker I rise today in support of parental and maternal rights and in opposition to H R 26 I am the first mother in history to represent west Michigan in Congress This matter is deeply personal to me I recently shared publicly about my own experience navigating a complex miscarriage and the loss of my daughter As a pro choice Christian who chose life this issue is so personal to me My faith informs my actions but it doesn t dictate the policy of an entire nation Further when I read the Scripture I am guided by passages like Jeremiah 1 5 which states I knew you before I formed you and I placed you in your mother s womb It doesn t say the government s womb or the Speaker s womb it says the mother s womb I believe life is precious but I reject the idea that if I embrace the sanctity of life I also must be forced to invite the Federal Government in to regulate it We must protect families from unnecessary government intrusion into the most sacred and personal decisions of our lives and our children s lives
438	Mr. Speaker I rise in support of the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act All life is sacred Defending innocent lives should not be a policy issue This legislation protects babies who are not only born but who are then left without care from an attempted abortion A baby who survives an abortion should receive the same medical attention that any other premature baby would These precious souls are given another chance at life It is unacceptable that there are no criminal charges for those who want to take their life away The people who allow babies to be killed after birth must be fully prosecuted Let s be clear Killing a baby who is born alive regardless of an attempted abortion is murder The previous Democrat controlled House has refused to vote on this bill Today a Republican led majority keeps our commitment to America by voting on legislation that upholds the sanctity of life I urge the passage of this bill on the House floor
439	Mr. Speaker I thank the gentleman from Ohio for yielding Just a couple of minutes ago we heard a speaker on the other side of the aisle criticize Republicans saying we don t support wearing masks and wearing masks affects others however having an abortion affects only a woman So what is an abortion What is an abortion It is the intentional taking of the life of an unborn child How in the world can you say that an abortion does not affect anyone except the woman That is the core of the difference between those of us who support unborn children and born children Those who support abortions ignore the fact that another life is involved That is the core of the issue There are two lives involved here the mother and the unborn baby We must recognize that
440	Mr. Speaker I rise today in strong opposition to H R 26 and urge my colleagues to instead support my motion to recommit to take up and pass Representative Judy Chu s Women s Health Protection Act that will restore the protections that we had under Roe v Wade If there is one thing this last election showed us it is that the American people believe strongly that every woman in this country should have the ability to make her own healthcare decisions including abortion Sadly however if there is one thing this past week has shown us it is that the House Republicans just don t care at all about that They don t care that 61 percent of the American people strongly support a woman s access to abortion care They don t care that just 2 months ago a record number of Americans showed up at polling locations across the country to overwhelmingly reject the GOP s plan to criminalize abortion care They don t care that in every State where abortion restrictions were on the ballot they were rejected overwhelmingly in places like Kansas They don t care that Americans think that people not politicians should be making these decisions Apparently my colleagues on the other side of the aisle think they know how abortion decisions should be made not a woman and her doctor So instead of taking heed of the will of the American people my Republican colleagues are intending to do just the opposite The legislation before us today is part of a concerted effort to fast track this extreme agenda of anti choice legislation It creates new criminal penalties for healthcare providers that fail to provide specific standards of care that the politicians on the other side of the aisle will enact after an attempted abortion It doesn t really protect newborn children in any way Why Because if a child is born it is already illegal to kill it as it should be Unlike what the majority leader said it is already illegal in every single State in this country It is illegal to kill people in this country Just in case anybody was confused about this as Chairman Nadler said in 2002 Congress passed the Born Alive Infants Protection Act and all of us including me the co chair of the Pro Choice Caucus voted for it because clearly if the baby is born we shouldn t kill it Duh So what does this bill do What it does as I said it creates criminal penalties for healthcare providers that don t do what the Republicans think they should do and it creates new complicated standards that will make it harder for healthcare professionals to do their jobs
441	What it does is it hopes to deter doctors from providing abortion care in the first place which is exactly what we saw after the Dobbs decision This is not what the American people signed up for I strongly urge my colleagues to reject these extreme measures and instead support my motion to recommit to take up and pass the Women s Health Protection Act to ensure that everybody in this country no matter where they live has the access to the reproductive care they need Mr. Speaker I ask unanimous consent to add the text of this amendment into the Record immediately prior to the vote on the motion to recommit
442	Mr. Speaker I thank the gentlewoman for her remarks I am a little bit confused though because it wasn t before 2002 when our previous Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia Governor Ralph Northam said on a radio show that if a baby was born alive that the baby would be made comfortable that then a conversation would ensue between the doctor and the mother about whether or not and how to treat that baby essentially saying if you want to go ahead and kill your baby after it is born go right ahead That type of attitude persists continues If there are laws that exist to prevent it the Governor was not aware of them I am not aware of them that would apply in that situation That is why this legislation is so important because contrary to House Democrats and the Biden administration the American people overwhelmingly believe that babies who are born alive should be protected that a baby born alive even after an attempted abortion should be afforded the same constitutional protections as every other American I am proud to support the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act which would require appropriate medical care for children who survive abortion procedures It imposes strong criminal penalties for the failure to provide such care If a doctor like our former Governor Dr Northam was engaging in the activities that he spoke about on that radio show he would be subject to those same criminal penalties Protecting living and breathing babies outside the womb should not be a partisan issue it should be one around which we all should unite I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation
443	Mr. Speaker I yield myself the balance of my time I will end this debate by reiterating the point I made at the beginning This legislation would do nothing to enhance protections or the quality of healthcare if an infant is born after an attempted abortion It has always been against the law to intentionally kill or harm a newborn infant whatever the circumstances of its birth It has always been against the law not to afford such an infant appropriate medical care The bill does nothing new to protect infants The bill however is not harmless Rather if enacted it could place the lives and health of newborn infants at risk The bill directly interferes with a doctor s medical judgment and dictates a medical standard of care namely immediate transport to a hospital that may not be appropriate in the particular circumstances That is why a broad coalition of healthcare provider groups joined by a wide range of additional health civil rights and women s rights groups strongly opposes this bill We should listen to these healthcare professionals We should support keeping babies alive which is what the Republicans say they want to do but yet they have this legislation that would endanger babies lives by dictating a standard of care that may not be appropriate in certain situations We should listen to these healthcare professionals This legislation is just another step in the Republicans plan to criminalize abortion nationwide The House must reject this seriously flawed bill and I yield back the balance of my time
444	Mr. Speaker I yield myself the balance of my time I will say that the document that launched this experiment in freedom we call America the Declaration of Independence talks about all are created equal endowed by our creator with life liberty and the pursuit of happiness I think it is interesting the order in which the Founders placed the rights they chose to mention life liberty and the pursuit of happiness You can t pursue happiness you can t chase down your goals and dreams if you first don t have freedom You don t have freedom and true liberty unless government protects your most fundamental right your right to live your right to breathe your right to life That is what this legislation is about protecting the most innocent the most vulnerable s right to life I urge a yes vote and hope this thing passes unanimously Mr. Speaker I yield back the balance of my time
445	All time for debate has expired Pursuant to House Resolution 5 the previous question is ordered on the bill The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time and was read the third time Motion to Recommit
446	Proceedings will resume on questions previously postponed Votes will be taken in the following order Adoption of the motion to recommit on H R 26 Passage of H R 26 if ordered and Agreeing to H Con Res 3 The first electronic vote will be conducted as a 15 minute vote Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX remaining electronic votes will be conducted as 5 minute votes
447	Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX the unfinished business is the vote on the motion to recommit on the bill H R 26 to amend title 18 United States Code to prohibit a health care practitioner from failing to exercise the proper degree of care in the case of a child who survives an abortion or attempted abortion offered by the gentlewoman from Colorado Ms DeGette on which the yeas and nays were ordered The Clerk will redesignate the motion The Clerk redesignated the motion
448	Mr Speaker last night Florida s First Congressional District lost an American hero who endured the tragedy of Pearl Harbor Chief Warrant Officer Frank Emond In 1938 Frank enlisted in the Navy as a French horn player where he went on to become band director On December 7 1941 Frank was preparing to play Morning Colors on the USS Pennsylvania when at 7 55 a m a line of Japanese planes came from the east with a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor Frank boldly walked to the conductor stand picked up his baton and proceeded to direct the band in The Stars and Stripes Forever Frank Emond was a true patriot who deeply impacted the lives that he touched doing what he loved to do music Frank led the Pensacola Civic Band the U S Air Force Band s Airmen of Note and currently holds the Guinness World Record as the world s oldest conductor My greatest condolences to Frank Emond s family Thank you Frank for being an American hero Your legacy is woven into the history of this country and this Congress

451	Mr Speaker on January 2 what started out as an exciting game for our beloved Buffalo Bills turned into a tragedy that captured the attention of the Nation It became instantly clear that Damar Hamlin s collapse on the field would be seared into our memories as a moment where you remember exactly where you were and who you were with But for millions of Americans across every political spectrum every background every race and ethnicity it was a moment of unity that reminded our Nation of the power of prayer It reminded us that our faith matters above all else In our dire moment of need our Nation turned to God just as Damar Hamlin would have wanted He is a man of unwavering faith who has spent his gift of life honoring God and spreading love I am happy to report today that Damar Hamlin was released from the hospital His recovery is a miracle May Damar s adversity serve as an inspiration to remind us all that despite any differences we may have we are one Nation under God and indivisible Go Bills
452	Mr Speaker I rise today as the Representative for the central coast of California which has endured some of the worst storms and flooding in recent memory to say thank you Thank you to our firefighters our emergency crews our search and rescue teams our law enforcement officers and all of our first responders and local leaders who have stepped up to save lives and protect property in our communities I share one story of this effort On Monday members of the Lompoc Fire Department reacted quickly to save a couple from rising flood waters As they carried out the rescue they discovered that moments before the woman had given birth Thanks to the quick work of the Lompoc Fire Department all three were rescued and are resting safely Mr Speaker our first responders have stepped up to avert further disaster this week and I am proud today to take a moment to recognize their service in the permanent Record of this body
453	Mr Speaker I stand here today to honor the lifetime of achievement of Mr James Holmes Following decades of service to the Culpepper community and 35 years of service to the Culpepper County Electoral Board Mr Holmes is stepping down as the current chair of the board at the end of this year Growing up in Culpepper Mr Holmes attended George Washington Carver School and was among the first integrated classes at Culpepper High School Mr Holmes determination to improve our Commonwealth for future generations of Virginians brought him back to Culpepper after he graduated cum laude from Virginia Union University and earned his J D from Howard Law School A licensed and ordained Baptist minister who has pastored in Culpepper for decades Mr Holmes has held many positions with the Wayland Blue Ridge Baptist Association From his service on the electoral board to casting an electoral vote in 2008 for our first Black President Mr Holmes has demonstrated a commitment to civic engagement and elevating the voices of Virginians within our communities Mr Holmes has touched many lives throughout his career as president of Culpepper Housing and Shelter Services president of the Culpepper County United Way president of the Culpepper County Equalization Board and as a caring member of his community Today I stand on the floor of the United States House of Representatives to thank James Holmes for his commitment to progress equality and community empowerment
454	Mr Speaker I rise today to condemn the Republican decision to weaken the Office of Congressional Ethics It is an independent nonpartisan office that reviews allegations of ethics violations by congressional Members It is a watchdog that makes sure that this Chamber operates in the best interests of the American people The Republicans voted to take control of it so they can limit investigations of Republican Members Republicans claim to represent Americans yet the first acts were not to help the working American families Instead they weakened the governmental oversight of their actions all done to make sure that they can abuse their power and push an unpopular agenda on the American people It is a disgraceful action that reveals the anti American nature of the Republican Party today
455	Mr Speaker last week House Republicans sadly displayed their incoherent and chaotic approach toward governing in this country But when it comes to ripping away the reproductive rights and freedoms of women across the country my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have never been more united Despite the many immediate challenges facing our country their priority was to criminalize abortion care and to put the health of women at risk The party that claims they want government out of our lives could not move more quickly to put the government and politicians in charge of one of the most personal decisions a woman can ever make Listening to my colleagues pontificate about the sanctity of life while attempting to take away life saving healthcare for millions of women is appalling I am proud to stand with House Democrats to continue to fight for reproductive freedom and reproductive justice and the right to abortion across the United States
456	Mr Speaker I rise in opposition to the changes the House rules package made to the Office of Congressional Ethics OCE is a critical independent ethics watchdog and it is a poor indication of the GOP s commitment to integrity that House Republicans have gutted the OCE as their first act in the majority The Republican rules package term limits the members of the OCE board and in doing so removes the three Democratic members of the bipartisan board giving Republicans a majority of seats instead of maintaining an even partisan divide These rules also require the OCE to hire staff within a month which requires a vote of four board members guaranteeing a partisan lean amongst most staff With these rules changes my Republican colleagues are deviously turning the Office of Congressional Ethics into a zombie alive in name but unable to execute its vital mission of investigating misconduct and ridding Congress of corruption After 14 failed Speaker votes and the undermining of independent ethics reviews House Republicans have demonstrated their commitment to dysfunction and poor governance
457	Mr Speaker I rise today to recognize the service of Dr Chris Farnitano Dr Farnitano has dedicated his career and his life to improving the lives of others and advancing wellness and compassionate care in the district that I represent in Contra Costa County and the San Francisco Bay area Over the course of his 30 years Chris has served in an important leadership role at the Contra Costa Regional Medical Center and its clinics and ultimately ended up as the Contra Costa County health officer in 2018 Chris commitment to promoting public health and well being in our community is apparent in all of the work he has done In 1997 he assisted in the development of the Pittsburg Health Center s HIV Medical Clinic which was the first of its kind in the Nation Chris was also instrumental in minimizing the spread of the coronavirus in our county and in the region Chris work has had significant impact on our community and our county admires his compassion and his dedication and wishes him well in his retirement
458	Mr Speaker we are now on the eve of the 25th anniversary of the historic Belfast Good Friday Agreement historic in large measure because of the American dimension through a negotiated settlement which helped to bring about the longest standing political dispute in the history of the western world It was the people of goodwill and both parts of the island that voted referendum questions to help bring about this remarkable achievement In this House the question of Ireland has always been bipartisan and it has been celebrated by both political parties here with great enthusiasm and so recognized Mr Kelly of Pennsylvania and I as chairpersons of the Friends of Ireland will be asking Members to sign the proclamation that we are offering through this resolution that will celebrate this historic achievement as we prepare across America the UK the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland for this celebration These have been it will never happen moments that we have all had a chance to participate in and I hope that Members will all sign this historic resolution celebrating and acknowledging this achievement
459	Mr Speaker I rise today to highlight the heroism of Paul Bandy his wife Aimee Johns and Heath Braddock On a clear summer day last year Steve Breummer a triathlete was doing his routine swim about 150 yards off the coast in Monterey Bay when he was attacked by a great white shark Pulled under water bitten across his thigh and abdomen and bleeding profusely Steve saw the cold black eye of that predator fought him off and yelled for help Paul a police officer and Aimee a nurse heard the cries and paddleboarded to the victim Heath who was onshore grabbed a surfboard and joined in the rescue Even though there was blood on top of the water and a shark lurked under the water all three heroes were undeterred got to Steve got him out of the water and saved his life For their actions the rescuers have been honored by the Red Cross and the Carnegie Commission Steve although not yet doing triathlons is walking and swimming again Today Mr Speaker I honor all of them for the determination to fight in the face of danger for their will to act despite it being to their detriment and fulfilling what it means to be a hero in our community on the central coast and in our country
460	Mr Speaker I rise today to highlight the incredible volunteer work of my constituent Ed Hannon of Charles Town West Virginia Ed began volunteering for fire and rescue services in 1978 at the age of 16 Ed took a job as a paid first responder in Arlington Virginia in 1983 but continued to give his time volunteering When he moved to Jefferson County in 1993 he joined the Citizens Fire Company Jefferson County has no paid fire and EMS personnel so they rely on dedicated volunteers like Ed to provide these critical services Ed ran his final calls on December 31 completing 44 years of dedicated volunteer service I wish Ed well in retirement and thank him for his service to the citizens of Jefferson County
461	Mr Speaker I don t know if I can top my friend from California s great white shark attack or talking about airline delays but we are going to do something that is particularly amusing and fun We are going to talk about why the fiscal house of the United States is collapsing For a number of folks who have watched my floor presentations a lot of this is going to be familiar This is a primer particularly for our new Members Right now we have hundreds and hundreds of new staff with the new Members here in the House of Representatives Hopefully on the thousand some televisions around the campus where you have C SPAN on please if you actually are interested if you really want to understand how much trouble we are in give me a few minutes of your time Actually give me almost an hour of your time Let s sort of walk through the reality I am going to walk through some of the solutions that are absolutely wrong and then we are going to talk a little bit about the reality of the math and the punch line we are going to come back to multiple times is really simple The primary driver of U S sovereign debt is our demographics Those of us who are baby boomers we got old And the political class here unless we are willing to tell the truth there is no path to saving us from a failed bond auction a failed debt crisis a world where we all live dramatically poorer And it doesn t have to be that way Look I know I am a broken record but damn it somehow we have got to get this to start to sink in So let s actually walk through some of the reality I always start with this chart because it is just easy to get your head around This is 2022 Now the funny thing is it looks like 2023 the percentage that is mandatory that means it is on autopilot Members here people like me we won t vote on it This is Social Security Medicare Medicaid These things that are a formula This percentage actually went down in this budget year It is not going down because we are spending less money it is because we are spending so much more money on discretionary it actually took several points more of the percentage of spending Now a lot of that was one time spending We will fade back down but you got to get your head around the majority The vast majority of U S spending is what we call mandatory It is entitlements It is you get because you work so many quarters It is because you turned a certain age because you are a certain Tribal group because you are a certain level of poverty you get these benefits and they are automatic It is a formula And then over here you see this little green part that is discretionary That is what we call nondefense discretionary This is what everyone thinks of as government That is your foreign aid that is your FBI that is the IRS that is all of those things And here the blue that is defense I am going to show you in some charts later my brothers and sisters on the left will often throw out rhetoric of cut out defense get rid it Believe it or not it is not even enough money to keep us in balance You could get rid of every dime of defense There needs to be an understanding of reality Your government is an insurance company with an Army I know that sounds like trying to be somewhat humorous but it happens to be the truth Think of it that way So what is the primary drive if I came to you right now and said you are a new Member of Congress you have made a passionate pitch to your voters that you are going take on the deficit Did you stand in front of your voters and tell them over the next 30 years 100 percent of the deficit is Medicare and Social Security The rest of the budget according to the Congressional Budget Office actually has a positive balance Over the next 30 years and this is based on the 2022 numbers with inflation some of this is actually worse today And we are not going to get the updated numbers till probably mid February using the Congressional Budget Office Functionally the shortfall of Medicare is about 75 percent of all of our borrowing The shortfall of Social Security and the reason you put that on there understand look at the Social Security actuary report It is not Republican it is not Democrat These are people that actually own calculators With the COLA that was just given you lost almost a full year of life So there is this trust fund Yes it is Social Security money that we have paid in over the years It is in loan to the Treasury The Treasury gives special Social Security T bills and then when Social Security needs money they cash them in with Treasury Fine And then actually the Treasury goes out and borrows other money That money runs out in about 10 years Two years ago I believe the Social Security actuary report said when the trust fund runs out our brothers and sisters who are 65 and older or who are 62 and older or whoever are just taking a Social Security check will get about a 27 percent cut I think last year s actuary report said about 25 percent cut It is based on here is our projection of the revenue and FICA taxes we take in today and then it goes out the door There is some data out there that says 10 years from now unless we fix Social Security you are going to double poverty among seniors What is the moral aspect there How many of this body are ready to actually deal with the political nightmare cascade of the trolls who lie oh excuse me the politicians trying to tell the truth about a multi multi multi multitrillion dollar system that is out of money and the negative shortfall You do understand I think the model said like in the next 60 years 65 years it is like 212 trillion short That is just the Social Security trust fund and it is gone in about 10 years It lost almost a full year of actuarial life with this year s COLA These are the things that we are here to fix instead of the trite crap we come behind these microphones and talk about These are the things that destroy a society because it breaks our promises Don t laugh at me My wife and I are both 60 and I have a 6 month old We adopted another child When my 6 month old is 25 years old two things We either blow up the debt and deficit which we are probably going to do that too or double the U S taxes When he is 25 years old we have to double corporate taxes import fees tariffs everything else every we call a receipt we got to double It means top marginal rates like 70 something percent That is just the Federal Do you understand what these numbers mean This was based on having 114 trillion of borrowing in today s dollars and these calcs were done before this inflationary cycle This is what takes down a republic How serious is this body really about telling the truth about the math Let s walk through the fragility Once again I am doing this substantially for the new Members and the new staff here to understand what reality is All day long you are going to get pitched by people with shiny objects or I need you to regulate this so I don t get competition in my business in the home district I want some free money I want you to give me a grant We get this inbound all day long We get the crazy conspiracy theory that has nothing to do with reality and that consumes our time instead of thinking about this math and coming up with actual solutions We have come to this floor over and over with solutions except it seems to terrify our brothers and sisters here because it means A telling the truth about the math and then it means we have to do things really differently You have to legalize technology You have to legalize the disruption because it is not about changing who pays Before I do this let me see if I can explain this For my fans on the left who love ObamaCare the ACA understand that it is a financing bill It just moves the money around I get subsidized over here but this group has to pay The brilliant Republican alternative was a financing bill Now we actually did a more elegant job of spreading it along the curve so you got some efficiency but it was still a financing bill It is who had to pay and who got subsidized Medicare for All is a financing bill None of those ideas in regard to healthcare change what we pay They just move around who pays Until the conversation becomes about what we pay you can t save us because the debt doesn t change With my very last board I am going to do something that is a little cranky and a little mean I am going to make fun of some of my own work but I am going to tell the truth that a lot of times when we talk 10 years to balance you do realize one of the things we are doing is saying we are going to take this portion of the spending and are just going to give it back to the State We are going to take this portion of the spending and make the users of Medicare or users of this group we are going to make the individuals pay We are going to take it off the Federal books but we don t change the spending as you would do the calculation as a percentage of the GDP or gross domestic product That is what is so important here Unless we legalize the disruption and do this quickly I had a meeting earlier in my office today with someone that is really smart He has been here for a long time He is a medical doctor He is one of my favorite Members David you have to go slower People aren t going to embrace it The bureaucracy is going to fight you Do you know how many vested interests there are in the lobbyist class and down on K Street We are watching the numbers erode I am going to show you a slide here that structurally 10 years from now we may have a structural 2 trillion a year deficit That is the structural deficit and half of that will be just interest Is this body ready to tell the truth about the math Because the math will always win One of the other things that terrifies me here is that we are not telling the truth about the fragility of interest rates I am going to do two or three slides here but you start to look at what happens if interest rates are up Rising interest rates could push up the national debt toward 300 percent Get this If the mean interest is 3 points over what CBO projected last year which believe it or not is actually closer to the mean of interest we have paid over the last 30 years so we go back to what was normal for the last 30 years we are at 345 percent of debt to GDP It is all gone If you care about the poor there is no more money for them If you care about defense there is no more money Basically every dime is just covering interest Government is gone The fantasy that goes on around here of let s talk about shiny objects but avoid the real crisis ahead of us I am going to show a bunch of slides that the Democrats proposals of raising taxes doesn t work and a bunch of the Republican ideas of let s get rid of waste and fraud We will get rid of foreign aid Do you realize every dime of foreign aid covers about 12 days of borrowing Last year we borrowed 43 600 a second How much of the conversation here is about my little Matthew who is 6 months old What is his future like Does anyone here give a damn about your kids your grandkids your own retirement This is everything This will take us down Will this body take it seriously You start to look at the charts This is where we are at right now Understand the CBO model is now starting to look at that 10 years from now 2032 That may seem like forever but it is 10 years What were you doing 10 years ago Do you remember It wasn t that long ago We are heading toward a structural cost just over 1 trillion just in interest just the interest cost Now add on another 1 trillion interest in spending and remember in that 10 years just Medicare and a portion of Medicaid go up 1 1 trillion The total budget 10 years from now goes up I think just a little less The CBO model from a year ago was about 2 trillion more that we are spending We take in about half a trillion plus more on due tax receipts It basically means you are heading toward a structural deficit close to 2 trillion a year and that is the baseline Now how many of you ran for office here and said I am going to balance the budget Okay Your structural deficit 10 years from now is 2 trillion What are you about to do I am going to move it to the States and let them pay for it I am going to play a shell game I am going to tell my voters it is waste and fraud I am going to tell my voters I need to tax businesses more We got old I am sorry but go back to that second slide Every dime of the borrowing for the next 30 years is three quarters Medicare one quarter Social Security Look at the comments that will be on the video of this and people say Oh that is not true Get rid of Ukraine Fine strip it but you just got rid of 12 days 14 days of borrowing It is this lack of ability to do math here but I am glad everyone gets their feelings satiated You have to understand this is the baseline we are at right now Thirty years from now half of all tax receipts go just to interest In Ways and Means we call it tax receipts tax revenues whatever you want to call it Half of it There is a model out there that if we are 2 points higher than the CBO model in 30 years it actually comes closer to 25 years all receipts if we kept the same tax code so all the things expire all the tax reforms we go back to the bad old days and we have 2 point higher interest rates so that is still lower than the previous 30 year mean Every dime of tax receipts in about 25 28 years every dime goes just to cover interest There is no more government We are nothing more than a bond house paying out interest Does anyone here understand this Doesn t this make anyone nervous Am I the only idiot getting up here and trying to point it out saying we are going to fall off the cliff Does anyone else care This is the stuff that is real but we are going to have a great conversation of virtue signaling probably over the next couple of weeks The math is out there for everyone Anyone that is watching just go to CBO some of the other groups that give a darn about the debt It is all over the charts You can get emails every single day talking about what is happening and the differentials We all ignore it because it is really uncomfortable to go home and stand in front of an audience of your voters and tell them the truth because we have lied to them for so long The Federal Government has a spending problem Now this may not look like a lot but you start to look at average tax receipts I have two or three slides that if you ever want to argue this I have done this with leftist groups trying to show when we raise taxes and when we lower taxes we always get within a certain band of about 18 to 20 percent of tax receipts in as part of the size of the economy There is just this sort of law of physics and taxes You raise taxes really high the economy and growth slows down you get 18 to 20 percent of GDP in taxes You lower taxes economy grows you get about 18 to 20 percent in taxes to GDP It is just about 100 years worth of data okay It is what it is What is happening is our spending you see this huge spike there That is COVID We went to crazy town It became an excuse to fund every dream every group trying to buy the vote for you Then you go back to our baseline and that baseline grows and grows You have to understand that spending here in just about 10 years crosses about 25 percent of the entire economy Yet our best model is we might be getting 18 19 percent of the economy in taxes That differential year after year buries us It is not falling revenues Look at it Even in the long term the best CBO data still has us hovering around 19 percent of the economy in tax receipts and it is within the mean of functioning since the 1960s There were years here where we had very high marginal tax rates some years where we had very low marginal tax rates and look at the band Do you see if I go way out if I go out to 30 years our spending hits 30 percent of the entire economy Thirty percent of the entire economy is spending and every dime of this growth out here is demographics It will be the shortfall of Social Security and Medicare Why is that so hard It is not Republican or Democrat We got gray Look at my hair There are fixes I have come here dozens of times I have walked through innovative solutions that disrupt the price of healthcare that disrupt the bureaucracy that make us more efficient that make us grow We ignore them because it turns out complex problems require complex solutions and it is not one magic bullet I am sorry Am I allowed to say bullet It is not one magic solution It turns out you have to do a dozen things and you have to do them all at once Yes you have to fix immigration You have to legalize technology You have to change the way bureaucracies work so that bureaucracies start using these supercomputers to collect data instead of making you fill out paperwork There are solutions out there but damn it this place needs to get rid of its 1990s solution and join this century I bring this board just to knock down one of my leftist friends who always said But you guys did tax reform and you cut receipts We are taking in 1 trillion more a year today than we did the year after tax reform It is spending 1 trillion more today so that is like a 25 percent growth in receipts in revenues in tax receipts post tax reform within functionally 4 years Don t tell me it is the tax reform because the tax reform grew the size of the economy Do you remember what it did to the Social Security trust fund It saved us for a couple of years because there were so many people working Could you imagine if we hadn t had the tax reform when we hit the pandemic Could you imagine if we hadn t had that healthy economy what the numbers would have looked like I am sorry I know this is repetitive but there is a reason I am saying it over and over I am trying to break through to people who have never really thought about the truth of the math Eliminating every dime of defense in the long term does nothing Think about that Here is defense Defense is going to be sitting around 2 7 percent of GDP and we are heading toward a time where just Social Security and the healthcare entitlements out here are over 15 percent of the size of the economy So defense is under 3 percent of the size of the economy just Social Security and the health entitlements are over 15 Does anyone see the issue But yet I will have my brothers and sisters on the left say It is defense we need to cut it Fine It doesn t do anything The scale of the dollars is so out of control we have got to stop living in a fantasy world I know it is good politics I know it is good virtue signaling You get your reporters and constituents at home going Yay that is true None of them own a calculator and if they do there are no batteries in it You have got to understand entitlement programs I don t like it when you call these entitlement programs call them anything you want call them mandatory spending Call them earned benefits they are earned benefits it is a societal problem I don t give a damn what you call them it is still about the spending You need to take a look at what it is driving Over here is the growth over those years defense just Social Security other mandatory Medicare all these the growth in these mandatories here How many Members here are bold enough to tell the truth Because when you tell the truth on this stuff you get attack adds you get groups that raise money lie about it beat the crap out of you if you are a Member of Congress I can t talk about that David In that case you can t actually talk about the debt and deficits Medicare Medicare Medicare Much of my life I have done healthcare finance As a child I was in my State legislature for a couple terms and I was working on our Medicaid system Even then you d have the experts come sit you down and say You do realize how much trouble we are in Well here we are 30 some years later Look at the curve The curve This isn t that long from now We are looking at numbers that are only functionally a decade from now This drives all policies If you are a Member and say I care about the environment Where are you going to get the money I care about defense Where are you going to get the money Healthcare is consuming everything I believe CBO in a couple weeks is going to update these numbers and they are going to look much uglier We have some of the back of the napkin math we have done with the Joint Economic Committee but I used last year s CBO number for this chart Here is my point once again Over the next decade there is functionally a trillion dollars of additional spending on Medicare If you add in Medicare and Medicaid it is one something Take a look here When you get out here this is a 1 1 trillion increase that is nine budget cycles from now It is not 10 years It is nine budget cycles from now So if I came to you and you saw the earlier chart it said okay a decade from now if the nominal interest rates stay where they are at our interest cost is 1 trillion a year a decade from now Now my additional spending on Medicare and Medicaid is an additional trillion dollars Does anyone start to see where a structural deficit of 2 trillion a year is Now you promised your voters you are going to balance the budget What are you going to do Just stop paying the interest on our debt Okay Stop paying Medicare Stop paying Medicaid Fine How about Social Security Because remember 10 years from now the trust fund is gone Our brothers and sisters who are on Social Security that rely on it are going to take what around a 25 percent cut Are we going to let that happen It is coming The math is real You can t pretend it away And you start to look at some of the lunacy that we get from our friends on the left Oh let s just tax more Even a 100 percent tax rate on small businesses and upper income families you can t even come close So take all their money and just assume that you live in some magic fantasy world where everyone keeps working Let s live in fantasy This is what you get My spending in 30 years is my borrowing is about 12 4 percent of GDP If I take every dime of someone who makes 500 000 or more the next dollar we just take it you get about 5 percent of GDP and that is pretending people would keep working The math is the math and we need to stop lying Look if you don t believe me you go look up CBO Go to Brian Riedl Manhattan Institute he does a beautiful job of taking OMB data CBO data some of the others out there and puts it on charts so that it is absorbable He walks through all of your solutions What if we repeal the tax cuts and raise the taxes on low income people How about if you get rid of every tax idea that is out there All the Democrat solutions You still fall incredibly short You get a fraction of what is required You go on some of the other solutions that have been offered No easy pay fors for Social Security or Medicare programs Everything falls short I need more than 6 percent of GDP And if I take almost every solution I only pick up a fraction of that The math is the math and the math will win Now here is the point where I am going to make some of my own friends on my side a little cranky I am going to tell the truth Many of the solutions we run around here and tout We are going to balance in 7 years We are going to balance in 10 years Do you understand the fraud We say Well we are going to cut Medicare Okay We are going to shift it to the individual We are going to do this We are going to take Medicaid and we are just going to cut our spending because we handed it back to the States They are shell gaming the math They are not willing to actually tell the system we are going to legalize technology This exists today The thing that looks like a large kazoo you can blow into it it tells you you have a virus It bangs off your phone to know you are not allergic to certain antivirals and orders your antivirals allowing that algorithm that technology to write a prescription You can t do that Why Do you know anyone with a diabetic pump All day long that algorithm is prescribing to them We have got to get this out because if you can t have that type of technology disruption my other idea is a much grander theory Five percent of our brothers and sisters who have multiple chronic conditions are over half of our healthcare spending We are in the time of miracles where we are seeing cures We as a body need to basically do an Operation Warp Speed as a way to save ourselves from our own crushing debt Bring those cures If it is true that a San Diego company which has just been bought up and was working with CRISPR has now cured about a half a dozen people of type 1 diabetes and we are trying to bring out one of their researchers to come talk to us in February if it is true if there is just the slightest opening of a door there is a path there I know that is type 1 I know type 2 we have our health issues What we do in our farm bill the fact that so much of our society has become almost self destructive with obesity yes I may have just hurt your feelings but dammit when government has to pay 70 percent of all healthcare costs we as a society should care I represent the population of probably the second highest per capita diabetes in the world one of my Tribal communities in Arizona When I meet people who are blind in that community who have lost parts of their feet is that compassion So what would happen if we can marry up legalizing the technology that will make your life easier and more convenient and make you healthier Yes it means that you don t walk into the urgent care center because you have a breath biopsy in your home medicine cabinet Legalize the technology Then we push as hard as we can if we are in the age of miracles cure cure cure because that is more moral and compassionate And dammit it has an amazing effect on U S debt Do you remember how many times I showed you that 31 percent of all Medicare spending is related to diabetes What would happen if you cut half of that Yes it is lifestyle Yes it is what people eat Yes it is exercise What would happen if we can give people back islet cells that produce insulin again We found a way to cure hepatitis C When I first got here this body was getting ready to try to figure out how to have hundreds of thousands of people get liver transplants and it was going to bankrupt Medicaid systems all over the country Then someone came up with a hepatitis C cure It was really expensive and we bitched about the cost of it except for the fact that it cured them And 7 months later there was a second drug that crashed the price Was that moral Of course it was Was it really good economics Was it just compassion Yes I need this to become part of our lexicon that the solution is disruption through technology Optionality But it is also the morality of we need to push those cures out because it is really good economics Instead of giving lists of things of here is how we are going to cut the debt and deficit we are just going to shift it to someone else to spend Is this body and particularly to the freshmen and the freshmen staff that I have been trying to talk to with this speech this will be the most important stuff you deal with in your time here It is not the shiny object that may get you on FOX News tonight It is not the shiny object that gets you applause when you go into your townhall meeting Oh we did this This stuff is hard It is complicated You are going to be lobbied like a war They are going to spend money in your district beating the crap out of you because you are taking away their money It also saves this country and gives my little Matthew who is 6 months old a future That is the morality Mr Speaker I yield back the balance of my time
462	Mr Speaker once again this morning thousands of Americans found themselves in airports staring at delayed and canceled flights This comes barely 3 weeks after tens of thousands of Americans and many of my own constituents missed the holidays because of the catastrophe on the part of the airlines the airlines that got billions of dollars in this Chamber from the American people barely 2 years ago This is how the airlines repay the support that this institution gave to them so that they could get through COVID Now the private markets will presumably address the failures of Southwest and other airlines What happened this morning was a failure of government The Notice to Air Missions is a function of the FAA I would like to point out that after last week when we heard constant cries for cuts to the budget understand my friends cuts to the budget means that we underinvest in the infrastructure that my constituents were relying on this morning As we think about the budget in the next 2 years let s remember what happened this morning
463	Mr Speaker I appreciate the comments from the gentleman from Arizona As he so often does in outlining the extent to which we have significant fiscal challenges that could be met with the kinds of reforms that we don t often talk about the need to reform healthcare policies healthcare decisions and things that get well beyond the rhetoric of balancing budgets on that he and I agree enormously I look forward to engaging with him on the floor of the House and other places on that topic again But I do want to say one thing that is true about what the gentleman from Arizona was talking about with respect to addressing mandatory spending reforming so called entitlements with respect to Social Security and Medicare and otherwise reforming those complex areas of our government If you can t tackle discretionary spending you are not going to tackle mandatory spending And importantly this is the critical part you have got to have the political willpower to address these things That is actually why I came to the floor this evening America was drawn into an engaging debate among the Members of Congress who represent them in the people s House last week C SPAN not constricted by the rules of the House was able to have cameras zeroing in on the Members of this body as we were debating last week People were drawn into the conversations the people on both sides of the aisle on the drama of the debates and how we would choose the Speaker of the House and then whether we would pass the rules package But here I am on January 11 2023 in the new Republican majority and I am alone in the Chamber again with the Speaker That is the requirement by the way There has to be a Speaker and then a Member on the floor But I am alone again Now we passed some bills today But what are we going to do as a body to make good on the reforms we passed last week and actually extend on them and build on them I would ask my colleagues why we don t have full debate right now on a number of the important issues of the day Why we don t have full debate tomorrow next week and the following week on the crucial issues of our day Today I called a colleague on the other side of the aisle to inquire as to which Members of the minority party would be willing to sit down with me and anybody else to figure out how to deal with the debt and the deficit spending that is plaguing our country My colleague on the other side of the aisle engaged in conversation about what that would take but the fact of the matter is that I don t know the answer What I would say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle is Come on down Where are you Are you going to simply take potshots at any effort by Members of my side of the aisle the majority now who dare to raise questions about how we might tackle 32 trillion of debt a trillion dollar plus deficits every year and tackle the question of interest rates going up causing our interest payments to go up every year Every 50 basis points every half of a percentage point that goes up adds about 100 billion a year in additional interest expense I think in the next year interest is going to eclipse our national defense spending Now where are all my defense hawks Where are all of my Republican colleagues who like to stand up and say We have got to fund our men and women in uniform we have to buy more planes and more bombers we have to have more guns and we have to make sure we have the strongest defense in the world Great I agree Peace through strength sparingly used non woke and trained to kill people and blow things up That is what I want our military to be and to do and I want it to continue to be the best in the world But we are not going to be able to do that if we are spending more on interest to the debt than we are on our own national defense As the gentleman from Arizona rightly is pointing out about the state of our mandatory spending and entitlements we are not going to be able to maintain our country have a strong national defense and ensure a peaceful world for our children and our grandchildren These are just facts We used to have a lot of political back and forth between Democrats and Republicans We would accuse our colleagues on the other side of the aisle of being tax and spend Democrats and they were tax and spend Democrats But something changed along the way We stopped debating tax policy for the most part and now everybody in this Chamber for the most part are spend and spend Members of Congress spend and spend members of a uni party Mr Speaker I am all on board with the enthusiasm the unity and the energy coming out of last week that we are going to transform this institution I believe it I believe by offering amendments in the appropriations process on the floor of this body we will be better I believe that by having 72 hours to read bills and not waiving that rule that we actually do it that we will be better I believe that by having single subject bills without them being multisubject complicated and thousands of pages that we will be better I believe that by requiring amendments to be germane that is actually related to the underlying purpose of the underlying bill that we will be better Those are all things that will make us better But they will only make us better if we are all united in the purpose of what we are trying to do I know I have got very strong disagreements with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle I have significant disagreements with a lot of my friends on my side of the aisle But Mr Speaker you will never solve those disagreements if you never sit down at the table and work The only way to work is to put some sort of constraint on our spending So with all due respect to my friend from Arizona Mr Schweikert with whom I agree about mandatory spending and about having to solve those problems in the long term discretionary spending matters Discretionary spending matters because it charts the priorities of a Congress that represents the American people We have to make the tough choices on discretionary spending Oh by the way that they are only 20 or 25 percent of the overall spending does not mean that they are not insignificant If we do not balance our budget right now and chart a course to balance that budget over the next 10 years we will spend an additional 10 trillion over the next 10 years that we don t have But what will happen is and here is what is going to happen this is important for the American people to understand we reached an agreement as a party last week to ensure that we return to 2022 levels of spending that is a top line level of 1 471 trillion and that we operate with that cap in spending that says nothing about what the levels are for defense or nondefense discretionary just that we would cap at 2022 levels of spending But here is what will happen We will have a debate about that and we will pass some appropriations bills If we do our job as Republicans we will pass good solid bills for this year s spending that stick within those caps and stay under the 2022 levels of spending We will send them to the Senate and Chuck Schumer will say with all sorts of wailing and gnashing of teeth that we are taking food out of the mouths of orphans and babies and that we are undermining the ability of people to survive and live and that we are taking away their medicine we are killing people and we are doing all sorts of horrible things As a result it will be September and we won t have an agreement and then there will be some brinkmanship a bunch of politics and a bunch of messaging and speeches and then there will be a continuing resolution that funds government at the current levels that were passed in December under that 1 7 billion omnibus spending bill that was passed on December 23 using Christmas as a backstop That is almost certainly what is going to happen if we don t stop it There are two ways to stop it Democrats and Republicans sit down and work honestly around a table to stop it or brinkmanship forcing the question by bringing it to the brink Those are the two possible ways that we can try to stop what I just described will occur from occurring This is the reality of what we have got to change in this body What else is going to happen Come summer at some time undetermined usually chosen by the executive branch as the maximum moment to be able to extract some sort of pain on the body we will be told that the debt limit is going to be reached That might be May or June or July or August Then we will be told You must raise the debt ceiling If any of us say Wait a minute why are we going to raise the debt ceiling if we don t stop doing the things that are causing us to accumulate more debt If any of us dare to say that what will happen Oh my It is already happening The Wall Street Journal all of the bond traders and the stock traders on Wall Street all of the investment bankers all of the brilliant economists and all of the opposing political party will all say Don t default on the debt You can t default on the debt so don t you dare demand that we actually change the things we are doing that are causing the debt because we might default on the debt So let s keep spending money we don t have and keep accumulating more debt increasing our interest payments and making it more difficult to service that debt while we undermine our own fiscal accountability and our own bonds ratings in the future But no no don t you dare Congressman Roy say that you might use the debt ceiling as leverage to extract fiscal reforms to stop the insanity Let me just be clear I think it is critical that we change the way we are doing business and I intend to use the debt ceiling to ensure that we get fiscal and structural reforms I am not going to bow down just because a few of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and a few pundits on TV write nasty editorials and some of my donors some of the people out there in the world and activists text you and say Oh my Gosh what are you doing You are going to risk default on the debt Do you know why I am not going to do that Because it is my job not to back down when people are afraid of what we are supposed to do here What we are supposed to do is bring things to a decision in this body responsibly All last week while we were debating the Speaker a whole bunch of my friends and supporters financial supporters were blowing up my phone with text messages A whole lot of them were saying Attaboy stand up fight for the American people change the institution and let us actually try to make that place work rather than continuing down this road of destruction But a whole bunch of them were also texting me saying What are you doing What are you doing We are not going to have a Republican Speaker We are going to get a Democrat Speaker You guys look like clowns What are you doing You look ridiculous You are making the Republican Party look ridiculous Chip Stop doing it Come Friday after 15 votes we came to a conclusion Nobody died and nothing went crazy We got a Speaker of the House and we got some agreements among all of us about how the body should proceed about ensuring we open it up have transparency offer more amendments and give greater ideological diversity among the committees Let s have a real debate on these things and let s get a really strong committee on the Judiciary Committee a Church style committee to look at how government is acting That is what we got by standing up and fighting and ignoring all of the handwringers who can t stand the heat Or to state it differently all of the handwringers out there in the chamber of commerce crowd and the donor class who basically want us to do their bidding so they can get richer That is the truth Don t default on the debt That might hurt my financial bottom line Chip Don t you dare rattle and have debates on the House floor that might rock the boat because my boat is pretty good Chip I am doing quite well Mr Speaker there are a whole hell of a lot of people in this country who are not doing well and I am not here to represent the donor class I am not here to represent the talking heads I am here to represent every hardworking American across this country and particularly in my district who are sick of the direction of this country So I am glad that we had the debate that we had last week I am glad that we captivated the American people s attention I am glad that C SPAN was free to show the conversation and the debate I am glad that we did something we hadn t done in 100 years because it is the two party system entrenched that has broken down the ability of Members of this body to actually be Members That is actually our job Putting politics and partisan politics aside it is our job as individual Members of this body to come here and do our job It is not our job for example to get on a committee and say and do whatever the chairman of the committee says which by the way is one of the things that happens in this town Our job is to get on the committee and work debate put good bills on the floor amend those bills debate those bills and pass some of those bills It is also not a race to introduce bills It is not a race to pass bills What would be wrong if we only passed about 30 bills this whole Congress Would that be a bad thing What if we only passed the 12 Appropriations bills did our job sent them to the Senate passed a handful of bills that would actually make our country better and then just sat back and worked a little bit and talked a little bit rather than running down to the desk to file another bill to introduce another statement to do another press conference to then run around and say Oh we have to pass a messaging bill Oh this is such and such week This is the week for police officers or this is the week for breast cancer awareness or this is the week for whatever somebody in the Hallmark industry decided the week was for Oh well we have to pass a bill Why Do you think we lack laws Do you think we lack regulations Do you think we need to spend more money that we don t have Why don t we just stop pause My message to my Republican colleagues is the best thing we could do for our country is to stop doing all the things that this body has been doing for as long as I can remember Whatever this body has been doing let s do the opposite How about that How about we actually have this Chamber full like it was last week Why don t we have hundreds of people on the floor and debate issues in front of each other Why don t we pick a day like Tuesday and have 50 Members from one side and 50 Members from the other side and call that debate day Let s debate Ukraine in full view of the American people Maybe the next week we can debate spending restraint how we are going to tackle spending I would like to listen to my colleagues tell me how you plan on tackling spending because right now my basic understanding of how my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would tackle spending is tax people or keep spending money or both My view on this side of the aisle is that we don t want to tax people but we want to keep spending money in the name of defense Anybody want to come challenge me on that assertion I am happy to debate them Either side of the aisle come on down Let s debate it I don t think anybody will take that debate on because they know I am right Why don t we change that Where are my colleagues on the other side of the aisle when it comes to spending I would like to know I think the American people deserve to know Do you believe in modern monetary theory just keep spending money and it doesn t matter I don t I think that is foolish I think it is reckless I think it undermines our dollar I think it undermines our financial stability More importantly I think it makes it impossible for us to make good decisions about how to make policy and execute policy How can you make a tough decision about whether or not you need to buy a bomber or whether or not you need to fund a particular grant program or fund a particular entitlement that is way oversubscribed and out of money How can you make a decision about that if the answer is just to keep printing money I mean that is my question I suggest there is no more important question for us to answer because if we don t then we are never going to come to agreement on the policies ever If I go home and talk to my wife and say Look we are going to cap our spending at our 2022 levels of spending then we have to make choices We have to decide well are we going to just not make our mortgage payment No we have to do that Are we going to not feed our kids Well no we have to feed our kids Are we going to have electricity and heat Well we would like to have that Then comes the discretionary questions Do you take a vacation Do you get a new car rather than patching together your 15 year old car Do you send your kids to a certain school Do you save a certain amount of money for college Maybe you forgo college because you look at college and say Why am I going to spend 300 000 to send them to college where they will teach my kids that America is evil I will save that for another rant That is my point We have to do that as families but this body never does it ever We pretend to do it The point of the agreement reached last week was to open this body up empower rank and file but also importantly establish some parameters for how we fund the Federal Government Those parameters should be that we set limits If you set limits now you have to sit down and figure it out Here is the problem I don t believe that Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats want to sit down at the table and figure out how to limit spending I don t believe that the President of the United States or his current Director of Office of Management and Budget or any of his team wants to sit down at the table with us and figure out how to limit spending I have not even heard them come down and say Well fine You are right Chip We are spending more money than we have and we are racking up more debt so we believe we need to increase taxes Okay Come make your offer We will raise taxes Show me how raising those taxes is going to eliminate the deficit He whispers It is not Show me how raising those taxes is not going to undermine economic growth make it more difficult for American people to get jobs undermine the prosperity of the American people Show me that Come demonstrate that He whispers That is not really that easy to do But our job is to responsibly represent the American people It is not to govern We often use that word That is crazy We don t govern We represent Our job is to represent our constituents I don t know any constituents frankly even my most left leaning constituents to be honest saying Oh yes please go up there and spend more money we don t have I would just suggest that according to the CBO we are going to see another 15 7 trillion in deficits over the next 10 years That is the truth The truth is that in fiscal year 2022 we collected a record 4 9 trillion in taxes nearly a trillion more than the previous year We don t have a revenue problem We have a spending problem We have an overpromise problem I had a reporter come up to me in the hallway a minute ago and say Mr Roy are there any circumstances in which you are going to support providing more aid to Ukraine How on Earth are we having that conversation on January 11 after on December 23 we just added another 45 billion for Ukraine The reporter responded and said They say that it is really important to get more money to beat Russia Oh really What do our experts say What is our responsibility to pay for that Do we just write a check anytime a world leader comes and says But it is really important for my people that you write me a check I want someone to write me a check minus all the ethics stuff Don t go write all that Look the truth is the gentleman from Arizona Mr Schweikert is 100 percent correct that mandatory spending Social Security Medicare all the related expenditures that go along with that are driving the vast majority of the debt that we are accumulating every year That is correct If you are not willing to take on discretionary spending how are you going to take on Social Security Medicare and reforming those to work when the first ad that is going to be run is going to be pushing granny off the cliff if you dare even have a conversation about the issue I will make an invitation to any colleague in the Chamber but particularly my colleagues on the other side of the aisle come down here and talk about Social Security and Medicare and all of our mandatory spending I will issue the same request that my colleagues on this side of the aisle acknowledge that you cannot hide behind Social Security Medicare and mandatory spending to say that we shouldn t limit discretionary spending defense spending because that is an insignificant part of the budget It is significant and it is significant not just because of the trillions of dollars of debt that those spending accounts for Defense Education Department of Justice Commerce and every other agency Homeland Security it is not just because we are spending too much money there and it is adding up to deficits and debts It is because we are funding the very agencies that are undermining us We are funding the bureaucrats who are undermining the current individual in America who is out there as an entrepreneur trying to get a job started It is undermining my friend Scott Smith in Loudoun County because we label him a domestic terrorist because the FBI was brought in along with the National School Board Association They all coordinated and said Okay let s label him a domestic terrorist We are funding a Department of Homeland Security that wants to continue to create or execute policies that invite more people to come to our border endangering them and us The reason you care about discretionary spending is because it funds the policies of government of the bureaucracy of the administrative state that undermines our well being undermines our prosperity We have the opportunity now right now as Republicans to lead the House of Representatives forward to change We should in fact change Last week was a monumental step forward to changing this institution to opening it up to allowing rank and file Members to have a say to putting more diversity on our committees to having more debate in committees coming down to the floor and fighting for the people that we represent All of that will be for naught if we don t embrace wholeheartedly the mission the hard mission of limiting the spending that is destroying our country and demanding that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle come sit down at the table so that we can actually do our jobs for the people we represent Then finally send a message to the United States Senate to the Democrat led United States Senate to the Democrat President of the United States at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue that it is not enough to give speeches It is not enough to oppose what we produce out of the people s House The American people spoke in November They want us to be responsible They want us to limit spending They want us to secure the United States They want us to have a secure and sovereign border They want us to get out of their business They want us to stop being at each other s throats If you want to do that then embrace fiscal responsibility and stop spending money you don t have to fund the bureaucrats who are undermining our liberties Stand up in defense of liberties civil liberties and the freedoms of the American people by calling out the bureaucrats in our committees and exposing it through oversight Stand up for a strong military that is nonwoke that is sparingly used but ready to go fight when needed Secure the border of the United States with the policies that are necessary to do so and embrace radical federalism where we return power to the States so we can agree to disagree and stop being at each other s throats Do you want to do those things Then there is one key thing you have to do You have to fight the swamp You have to take on the bureaucracy You have to take on the powers that be That started last week We have some of the tools that we need but that battle is just beginning We are going to take this town on for the American people Mr Speaker I yield back the balance of my time

467	Mr. Speaker I rise today because 2 months ago Americans sent a clear message to Congress rejecting the extremist anti abortion anti reproductive health policies of the GOP Yet here we are today on our first week in Congress voting on legislation that puts women at risk by jeopardizing the ability of medical professionals to perform lifesaving care Under the Republican agenda women do not have the right to make decisions about their own bodies and about their own healthcare Make no mistake this is yet another step toward the GOP s ultimate goal of criminalizing abortion nationwide and banning contraception while doing absolutely nothing to address the real issues impacting parents children and families across our country House Democrats will fight to protect abortion rights to maintain access to contraception and to not put the government between women and their doctors The GOP s decades long demonization of reproductive healthcare providers has resulted in targeted violence as well as continual harassment of those seeking abortion care Yet instead of speaking out against these heinous crimes the GOP is focusing on a resolution that picks what type of violence is unacceptable to them when in reality violence should be condemned in all forms no matter what groups are being targeted For this reason I am co sponsoring a House Resolution that condemns attacks on healthcare facilities healthcare personnel and patients This Resolution condemns the hatred violence and harassment that abortion providers reproductive health advocates and other healthcare providers have faced for providing essential healthcare services to women across our country I call upon our colleagues across the aisle to condemn violence regardless of whom it is being directed at and I invite them to do so by adopting this language into their resolution

481	Mr Speaker after all the excitement over the Speaker s race last week it was good to get down to work this week or not Let s recap The new Republican majority protected rich donors from paying their fair share in taxes naturally and in the process delayed working families from getting their tax refunds Way to go Next up a select committee on the so called weaponization of the Federal Government Nothing like a Joe McCarthy style committee to stoke more fear and distrust of the Federal Government only 2 years after the attack on our Capitol And then criminalizing women s healthcare because of course that is why the American people gave the Republicans the majority The red wave the Republicans dreamed about never materialized because the American people rejected their far right agenda up and down the ballot Clearly they didn t get the message Yet they did nothing to tackle inflation the biggest issue for the American people in the last election Mr Speaker this isn t what the American people signed up for It is going to be a long 2 years if this is all they are going to do

484	Mr Speaker it should not be a partisan issue to support democracies globally and in particular affirm the results of the free fair and credible Presidential election in Brazil last fall The radio silence of my Republican colleagues regarding the January 8 attack on Brazilian democracy is inconsistent with their professed concern over freedom On a bipartisan basis we should denounce a would be autocrat who refuses to accept the results of elections and is taking refuge within the United States Our contempt should also extend to American extremists who are undermining democratic institutions at home and abroad Our commitment to democratic freedom cannot be selective Fascism and communism are two sides of the same authoritarian coin Standing up for democratic values is not just about standing up to the Chinese Communist Party It is about condemning autocratic movements globally We must defend democratic institutions here and everywhere including any conspiracy undermining Brazilian democracy

486	Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr Speaker I rise today in support of H R 22 the Protecting America s Strategic Petroleum Reserve from China Act America is suffering through the worst energy crisis in decades President Biden and the Democrats radical rush to green agenda is making life unaffordable for people all across this country It is driving record inflation straining household budgets and weakening our electric grid Under President Biden and the Democrats control of Congress gas prices rose to the highest levels in history Some were forced to pay more than 6 per gallon Gas prices are still 40 percent higher today Diesel prices are up almost 2 a gallon more than when President Biden took office The Federal Government should not be in the business of picking winners and losers especially when it makes us more dangerously dependent upon China for critical minerals solar panels and batteries to produce our own energy and electricity and strengthens Russia and OPEC s grip on world oil and gas markets Now to cover up his failed policies driving our energy and inflation crisis President Biden drained our Nation s Strategic Petroleum Reserve at an alarming rate America s Strategic Petroleum Reserve once the world s largest stockpile has been depleted to the lowest levels since 1983 President Biden released an unprecedented 250 million barrels of oil in less than 2 years more than all former Presidents combined As we know much of that oil went to China because our refineries and pipelines are full It now has nowhere to go here In April the Biden administration sold a million barrels directly to a state owned Chinese company Millions more barrels went to overseas traders who eventually sent it to China We also know that China is ramping up its purchases of crude oil from Russia and the U S to boost its own reserves China now controls the world s largest government controlled stockpile of oil with almost a billion barrels at the expense of American taxpayers and our energy security America s Strategic Petroleum Reserve is meant for true energy supply disruptions like those caused by hurricanes and natural disasters not to help China Draining our strategic reserves for political purposes and selling portions of it to China is a significant threat to our national security The administration is not just hurting our own ability to respond to emergencies and national security events they are actively bolstering the oil reserves of our most dangerous geopolitical adversary the Chinese Communist Party This is unacceptable and it must stop Mr Speaker I urge my colleagues to support this bill and prohibit the sale and export of Strategic Petroleum Reserve crude oil to China H R 22 prevents the Secretary of Energy from selling any products from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to any entity owned by or under the control or influence of the CCP or selling to any other entity that intends to export to China Enacting H R 22 preventing the Biden administration from wasting our strategic reserves is the first step toward flipping the switch and unleashing American energy production America has led the world in reducing carbon emissions and promoting innovation by utilizing our abundant clean affordable and reliable energy We can restore this leadership without sacrificing our energy security or making everyday life unaffordable for people That starts by enacting smart workable all of the above strategies that build on this legacy by lowering costs and emissions across the country It includes making our infrastructure and electricity grid more resilient and unleashing innovation for cleaner natural gas emissions free hydropower and nuclear power and carbon capture technologies Republicans support a level playing field with a balance of energy sources but without handing the keys of our energy future over to the Chinese Communist Party It is time to cut the red tape expand energy production here at home modernize our infrastructure invest in new technologies and create opportunities for jobs and economic development right here in the United States of America I look forward to passage of this bill today and I am eager to get to work with my colleagues on additional solutions to make energy cleaner more affordable and more reliable for all Americans Mr Speaker I reserve the balance of my time
487	Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr Speaker let me begin by congratulating the gentlewoman from Washington State on her election as the chairwoman of the Energy and Commerce Committee I rise in opposition to H R 22 the Protecting America s Strategic Petroleum Reserve from China Act First let s take a moment to remember how we got here In 2015 when Republicans last controlled Congress they lifted the 40 year ban on crude oil exports at the urging of their Big Oil friends This irresponsible policy change allowed companies to export American owned barrels of oil to our adversaries including China Again that was a Republican policy pushed by House Republicans 8 years ago As a result our crude oil exports to China surged averaging a half million barrels every day during the last year of the Trump administration China hoarded these barrels to build up its own petroleum reserves Back in 2015 I strongly opposed this Republican bill out of concern that it would harm our energy security and ultimately lead to increased prices at the pump for hardworking American families It turns out I was right Now Republicans seem to be complaining about the very circumstances that they created all to reward their Big Oil friends Lifting the export ban damaged our economic security Refineries across the country including in my home State of New Jersey have closed since the export ban was lifted in no small part due to oil companies desires to seek greater profits abroad rather than send their oil to refineries here at home A GAO analysis in 2020 showed that domestic refineries suffered because of the export ban being lifted a suffering that was then inflicted on the thousands of hardworking Americans whose jobs were destroyed If Republicans were serious about addressing this issue they would have brought forward a bill that banned all exports of crude oil to China SPR barrels sold to Chinese firms represented only 2 percent of all the oil we sent to China last year only 2 percent from the SPR If we truly want to address China using American oil to build its reserves let s actually take a serious look at that rather than skirt around the issue because Republicans are scared of Big Oil s wrath Why are Republicans only banning SPR sales to China Representatives Houlahan and Bacon introduced a bill last Congress that prohibited SPR sales to Russia North Korea Iran and any country under U S sanctions That bill had 37 bipartisan cosponsors Are my Republican colleagues okay with exporting oil to Putin s Russia in the midst of a war on Ukraine It also speaks volumes Mr Speaker that this is their first energy priority after regaining the House majority Over the last 2 years Democrats passed the most significant climate law in our Nation s history We also passed the bipartisan infrastructure law that will modernize our energy infrastructure Republicans first energy bill this Congress isn t about investing in the resiliency of our electric grid or making American energy cleaner and cheaper Instead they are just recycling an old one page bill that takes a minor step in undoing the damage that they themselves created Republicans are here today denying their own history and muddying the truth by trying to place the blame on President Biden but President Biden successfully used the SPR to lower prices at the pump and provide relief to American families When gas prices increased last year the Biden administration took decisive action to bring gas prices back down by releasing oil from the SPR The administration released an unprecedented 1 million barrels of oil a day providing critical domestic supply to make up for shortages in the aftermath of the war in Ukraine This was a commonsense strategy that worked and thanks largely to President Biden s actions gasoline prices have fallen an average of 1 90 per gallon nationwide since their peak in June One thing that episode underscores is that fossil fuel prices are volatile As long as we rely on gasoline and other fossil fuels to meet America s energy needs our country s energy security and affordability remain at the whims of dictators like Putin on the other side of the world While I agree just like I did back in 2015 that we should not export U S crude oil to China I want to stress that this bill could have been improved through bipartisan cooperation regular order and committee consideration If Republicans hope to actually enact legislation this is not a pathway to success Mr Speaker I reserve the balance of my time
488	Mr Speaker I thank the chairwoman for yielding I want to speak in support of Protecting America s Strategic Petroleum Reserve from China Act Mr Speaker the Republican majority is wasting no time in making good on our commitment to the American people to reverse this reckless agenda that the Biden administration has followed Republicans understand that energy policy is foundational to a thriving and dynamic national economy and for too long we have watched as Democrats energy policy was kind of an experiment for their radical agenda Unfortunately they hurt the American people in the process Interestingly in July 2020 Senator Cornyn and I had a bill to allow filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve while prices were at historic lows It was blocked by the Democrats They wouldn t even consider it Today we have an opportunity to protect America s resource and refill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve so it can be used as it was originally intended to protect our people at times of crisis
489	Mr Speaker I thank Ranking Member Pallone for yielding the time America should not be exporting our crude oil exports to an adversary and that was our national policy for 40 years until a Republican controlled Congress authorized sending American crude oil abroad in 2015 China exploited that ill advised policy change and exports of American crude oil to China increased nearly a hundredfold during the Trump administration to about 391 million barrels Last year in response to soaring gasoline prices caused by Putin s unprovoked attack on Ukraine President Biden successfully used the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to lower prices at the pump and provide relief to American families This was a commonsense strategy that worked Gasoline prices have fallen an average of 1 90 per gallon nationwide since their peak last June However we cannot keep relying on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to keep oil prices in check That is why Democrats have focused on lowering costs and avoiding price spikes through the Inflation Reduction Act because cleaner cheaper energy is our future It will lower costs create good paying jobs and help us build safer more resilient and healthier communities Plus this bill is way too narrowly tailored What we should be debating today is the farsighted bill offered by my colleagues Congresswoman Chrissy Houlahan and Congressman Don Bacon a bipartisan bill that would completely ban all crude oil exports to China That is a much stronger bill In addition to China it would ban crude oil exports to all of our adversaries including Iran and North Korea In the end America s future is in clean energy That is how we are going to lower the cost of energy for American families provide good paying jobs and make sure that we provide a livable planet to our kids and future generations Mr Speaker I appreciate the gentleman and I congratulate Mrs McMorris Rodgers for taking the gavel of the Energy and Commerce Committee and I look forward to working with her in the 118th Congress
490	Mr Speaker I rise in support of the Protecting America s Strategic Petroleum Reserve from China Act legislation offered by my good friend the gentlewoman from Washington State and the chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee Over the first 2 years of the Biden administration we have seen an unprecedented level of hostility toward America s energy producers The administration has made every effort to undermine avoid and restrict oil and gas production in North America while at the same time moving to drain our strategic reserves in an attempt to offset the price increases caused by the President s own policies Playing politics with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve has resulted in the lowest level it has been in decades If this wasn t alarming enough just wait until you hear who has benefited from our reserves being drained the Chinese Communist Party As part of this administration s Strategic Petroleum Reserve sales a little under 1 million barrels were bought by UNIPEC the Chinese Petrochemical Corporation The shortsightedness shows the Biden administration is willing to put our national security at risk by selling vital reserves to our adversaries to manipulate market prices in hopes of getting political advantage This is not right and every single Member of this body should be opposed to such actions While we investigate these actions we must ensure they never happen again That is why I am proud to be an original cosponsor to the Protecting America s Strategic Petroleum Reserve from China Act This bill would prevent the Secretary of Energy from selling any products from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to any entity owned or under the control or influence of the Chinese Communist Party or to any other entity that intends to export products to China Mr Speaker I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation
491	Mr Speaker while my Republican colleagues have promised to secure America s energy future I share this goal and I am eager to work together Again I congratulate our new chair However I would say that the path to energy security is not through cheap political rhetoric or Biden bashing but through bipartisan policy solutions We all agree that oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve should not be sold to our adversaries To prevent this Representatives Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania and Don Bacon of Nebraska introduced the bipartisan Banning Oil Exports to Foreign Adversaries Act last July and reintroduced it yesterday with 34 Democratic and 7 Republican cosponsors The bill prevents the sale or export of oil from the SPR to China but also North Korea Russia Iran and any country currently under U S sanctions I bet it would be approved by voice vote in this House today By contrast the bill we are debating today only prohibits SPR sales to entities affiliated with China Given that a more comprehensive bipartisan bill already exists why would our colleagues be putting forward a more partisan bill with a partial solution that won t pass the Senate Let me be clear Americans are looking for serious policy results not half baked ideas designed for a press release If my colleagues across the aisle are serious about energy independence let s talk about that They will have to acknowledge that our path to true energy security is not by doubling down on oil We have seen the costs of oil price shocks time and time again In the 1970s the Arab oil embargo caused oil prices to soar In 1990 the first Gulf war spiked record prices In 2005 Hurricane Katrina damaged refining facilities causing prices to rise again Between December 2007 and July 2008 prices rose from 118 a barrel to over 160 per barrel before crashing during the Great Recession In the last few years we have seen rapid volatility from negative prices during the pandemic to over 100 a barrel during the recovery It is becoming very clear that we have to admit that doubling down on oil is a failed strategy and true energy security will be achieved by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and investing in clean fuels of the future Let s do that for our taxpayers as well as for the environment I look forward to working together on real solutions
492	Mr Speaker I just want to clarify Russia and Iran well Iran is part of OPEC so they are not the ones buying out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve As a matter of fact President Biden went to OPEC to ask them to increase their production instead of doing American oil Mr Speaker I also want to say 2015 to finish the sentence it was a Republican controlled Congress in 2015 it was also the Obama administration worked together in a bipartisan way to unleash American energy or give them a worldwide market for American energy and when you threw in President Trump s administration and a regulatory environment that made sense we had record production of energy We did ship it throughout the world We also had record low prices here in America The problem we are facing today is because of President Biden and the Democrats in Congress war on American oil That is the problem we are here to address The price of gasoline hit over 5 a gallon in the height of this war on oil 4 80 a gallon in Kentucky when it was just over 2 20 when President Biden took office American families are hurting because of this small business owners are hurting because of this and they continue to struggle Instead of taking action to meaningfully unleash America s energy potential President Biden opted to release supplies from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve What we need to do is get back to unleashing American energy not sending out of our Strategic Petroleum Reserve Even worse President Biden s abuse of our Strategic Petroleum Reserve has reduced our stockpile by more than 250 million barrels jeopardizing our ability to respond to supply disruptions posed by natural disasters and other true emergencies This includes selling millions of barrels of oil from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve to adversarial countries including China By prohibiting our strategic reserves from being sold to China this legislation is a significant step toward restoring our energy security and providing needed relief for hardworking Americans We have the ability to produce we need to move forward and we need to ban SPR from going to China and we need to move forward on American energy
493	Mr Speaker what political nonsense this bill is It allows an American oil company to buy oil from the SPR on Monday and sell it to China on Tuesday which means it is fine for them to see SPR oil going to China as long as an American oil company makes a little money out of it And of course as the ranking member points out it allows all the other oil in the country 98 percent of our exports to China to go to China unchecked If we were serious about lowering prices for the American consumer we would look at what the Republicans did in 2015 when they ended our ban on exports and insisted that that be added to the spending bill that shut down the government I had a bill introduced last month to ban American exports of oil when oil is selling for over 70 a barrel We need to ban the exports of natural gas when prices are too high for American consumers Finally this bill tries to attack the Biden administration s use of the SPR to lower gas prices here where it has been somewhat effective and has made money for the United States Treasury Let s legislate seriously to lower oil and natural gas prices for the American consumer instead of simply insisting that if American SPR oil goes to China an oil company has to be a middleman and make a little money off of it
494	Mr Speaker I congratulate the gentlewoman on her chairmanship and I look forward to working with her Mr Speaker I rise in support of this legislation It is high time to stop the Biden administration from continuing to provide China with oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Under the current administration we have only seen a war against domestic energy production As a Band Aid to cover up the consequences of Biden s policies resulting in unprecedented high energy prices it chooses to draw down the Strategic Petroleum Reserve a critical national security asset Drawing down these reserves to cover up failed policies is wrong but doing it and then selling that oil to China our chief adversary is un American in my opinion
495	Mr Speaker today we have an opportunity in this Congress to close a loophole that has been open since 2015 a loophole that enables our adversaries to purchase oil from our U S Strategic Petroleum Reserves There is a bill indeed to close that harmful loophole a bill that will strengthen our national security a bill that will signal to our fiercest adversaries that we will not bend a knee to those who threaten the safety of our allies and our servicemembers both here and abroad I am not talking about the bill that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have put forward today but rather I am talking about a bipartisan bill my bipartisan bill the Banning Oil Exports to Foreign Adversaries Act We hear this phrase frequently in this Chamber It is that simple So let s make this argument really simple very very simple Our new majority has put forward a partisan bill that bans the sale of American oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve only to China I have put forward a bipartisan bill with Representative Don Bacon and now with 44 others that would ban the sale not only to China but also to North Korea Russia Iran and to all other adversaries It is modeled directly after similar and relevant legislation that I also introduced successfully in the NDAA regarding our critical minerals and rare earth element stockpiles This bill my bill is stronger it is bipartisan and it has a chance in the Senate This bill the bill we are talking about today is weaker it is partisan and it will unfortunately likely never see it past the Senate s legislative graveyard Mr Speaker it is very hard to hear my colleagues talk about returning to proper and regular order in the House when in fact if this very bill followed proper order and went through committee we would likely be voting on a different piece of legislation today My Republican colleagues know my background I am one of the most bipartisan Members of this body and proudly served in the military for 13 years I am here today because we have a chance to put our national security above our party politics I call upon my colleagues all of them to join me in good faith to support the bipartisan Banning Oil Exports to Foreign Adversaries Act Let s send this legislation through the proper order strengthen it and work together to get it signed into law I urge my colleagues to look at the facts and to show servicemembers and veterans that we put their safety and their sacrifice ahead of political gamesmanship Before I conclude I do want to thank my dear colleague Representative Pallone for his leadership and for having included this bill my bill in the Buy Low and Sell High Act of last Congress
496	Mr Speaker today I rise in support of H R 22 led by our Energy and Commerce Committee chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers Earlier this week it was reported that after President Biden drained over 200 million barrels out of America s Strategic Petroleum Reserve his Department of Energy is now rejecting multiple bids to refill it saying that oil is too expensive Mr Speaker this is hard to believe This administration who has put a stranglehold on domestic production by canceling pipelines reducing drilling halting leases and proposing burdensome regulations is now telling the American taxpayer Sorry we depleted your national reserves sold some of it to China and now we won t refill it because it is too expensive Aren t they the ones making oil more expensive It is as if President Biden thinks the SPR is his strategic political reserve to be used as a Band Aid for his failed energy policies Mr Speaker this legislation is a needed course correction in our national energy strategy and I urge my colleagues to support it
497	Mr Speaker I rise to address a drafting error in this bill The stated goal of H R 22 is to prevent aid to China and lower U S energy costs As written it is going to have the opposite effect Run the math In 2022 the SPR released about 210 million barrels of oil Most of that was consumed domestically a small fraction was exported and a smaller fraction may have gone to China During the same period of time domestic oil producers exported more than 10 times that volume so roughly 100 times the volume that was exported from that portion of our SPR that happens to be above ground So the failure to include U S producers in the export prohibition means that this bill will do nothing to limit Chinese access to American oil But since the SPR releases as the majority notes do reduce oil prices curtailing our ability to use that tool will drive prices up and transfer wealth from U S consumers to U S producers in places like Bakersfield California as they sell higher priced oil to China Now I cannot imagine that the Speaker intended to enrich his neighbors so that they could profit from Chinese oil sales so I would encourage him to vote no I would also encourage anyone who seeks to prioritize United States access to United States energy to oppose until we can make the necessary corrections to this bill
498	Mr Speaker I rise to speak in favor of the Protecting America s Strategic Petroleum Reserve from China Act Under the Biden administration we have seen a continuous assault on American energy that has killed jobs increased our dependency on foreign energy sources and caused energy costs to soar In an attempt to lower energy prices the administration has sold millions of barrels of petroleum from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve depleting our own supply and helping China to build the world s largest crude oil reserve This must stop I call on all my colleagues to join me in voting for this legislation to stop the Secretary of Energy from selling any more petroleum products from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to China
499	Mr Speaker I thank the gentleman for yielding Mr Speaker I rise today to oppose H R 22 the Protecting America s Strategic Petroleum Reserve from China Act Let s get one thing straight The reason we are here today considering this bill is because Republicans in Congress voted in 2015 to repeal a 40 year ban on the export of crude oil including to our foreign adversaries Despite this being a problem of their own making my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have seemed more interested in playing political games with our country s energy security than offering concrete effective solutions for the American people When Vladimir Putin s brutal invasion of Ukraine and Big Oil s unchecked corporate greed caused gas prices to spike last year the Biden administration took decisive action to lower prices for working families by releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Not only did this move help protect the wallets of my constituents and Americans all across the country reports also indicate that our government returned a nearly 4 billion profit on these sales So if my Republican colleagues would like to get serious about standing up to our adversaries I would be happy to consider such proposals But I cannot support this piecemeal legislation drafted for the purpose of scoring cheap political points rather than actually solving the problem of high energy costs Mr Speaker I urge my colleagues to vote no
500	Mr Speaker I thank the gentlewoman for yielding Mr Speaker I rise in support of H R 22 because there is nothing strategic about an empty Strategic Petroleum Reserve What is worse than not having a strategic reserve is selling it off to adversaries so they can build their own That is exactly what has been happened over the past 2 years While our SPR has been depleted in an attempt to cover up the failed energy policies of this administration China is taking advantage by building up their own reserves The worst part is that their build up has come from the U S reserves Let me repeat this President Biden has sold our valuable Strategic Petroleum Reserve to China while Americans face the highest energy prices in a generation and a Federal Government that has failed to adequately address it by unleashing our own energy potential And every barrel sold to China makes that decision even more damaging Mr Speaker I urge my colleagues to support H R 22 to prevent the administration from selling any SPR products to the CCP or related entities Stop the attacks on American energy unleash it and make us energy independent
501	Mr Speaker I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for yielding Mr Speaker I rise to point out to my colleagues some context and facts that are totally missing from this debate Exports of oil from the SPR regardless of destination were not a problem before 2015 Many of us were here and we remember exactly why that 40 year policy of the United States a ban on crude oil exports changed It changed because that year a Republican controlled Congress insisted on lifting the export ban The Republicans in charge at that time refused to consider an amendment that was offered by our friend and former colleague Representative Gene Green That amendment would have required exporters to have a permit finding that their export of crude oil was consistent with the national interest Republicans did not create any restrictions on the destination of oil exported from our strategic reserves or any other source If Republicans had not lifted that export ban we would not have this problem If Republicans hadn t blocked Representative Green s amendment from even being considered on the floor of the House we would not have this problem Instead we are left with a Republican messaging bill which purports to address a small part of the problem while ignoring the much bigger problem that they created back in 2015 If my friends across the aisle were truly concerned with U S oil exports going to China then they would put a more serious measure forward At the very least they would block not just some small amount of petroleum from the SPR but the sale of all crude oil exports to China which includes much larger volumes outside of the SPR In the international market we don t know where crude oil ends up once it hits the global marketplace That is the way it works Sales to entities with connections to China may not go to China Sales to entities with no connection to China may go straight to China That is just how it works The fact is the only way we can be sure that U S crude doesn t end up in the hands of foreign entities of concern is to reinstate that crude oil export ban I agree with my friends across the aisle We shouldn t be exporting our strategic oil reserves to China I just wish they hadn t gotten us into this mess in the first place and I wish they would put forth a more serious bill now
502	Mr Speaker I congratulate the gentlewoman from Washington on her chairmanship Before the Biden administration s war on American energy America was increasingly dominant in energy production producing a surplus a surplus Exceeding demand usually means that you can have lower prices because you are providing supply that exceeds demand and then when we have more supply we can export We can export to our allies at prices that actually compete with the OPEC cartel on the open market That is what American energy dominance can do My colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to keep pushing green energy initiatives such as wind and solar I think those are groovy technologies Guess what Mr Speaker You cannot export renewable energy You can export oil and gas in order to lower prices and increase stability for our friends in Europe who are more reliant on Vladimir Putin for their energy Do you know what Mr Speaker For political purposes President Biden sold off a strategic asset of this Nation He started dumping oil out of the SPR the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and put it out there so that China could buy it and China did buy it This is an American asset Do you know what Mr Speaker This bill that prohibits that oil from being sold to China and other adversaries makes sense but the Democrat talking points make none
503	Mr Speaker energy security is a key component of our national security Our energy exports have a security impact around the world as they do here at home That is why I am disappointed this morning to hear many of my friends across the aisle criticizing and blaming President Biden for taking action to lower gas prices for American consumers and to weaken Russia s ability to fund its unconscionable and unjustified war that is unprovoked against Ukraine by selling oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve The SPR is a critical foreign policy tool and energy security tool and it has been for more than 40 years The SPR was created for this precise purpose for this moment that we are living in and these recent sales like every sale of crude in the U S are made on the open market to any entity wishing to purchase it The effective utilization of the SPR has successfully lowered costs at the pump for Americans over the last year In December The Wall Street Journal reported that U S Government made roughly 4 billion in profits last year from the sale of crude oil out of the SPR This is an important point to remember because it is the direct work of this body In 2015 the Energy and Commerce Committee under Republican leadership lifted the 40 year ban on crude oil exports I wasn t here at the time but if I had been I would have supported my Republican colleagues in that effort to acknowledge the global free market for the commodity and the importance of ensuring America s energy security and leadership But it isn t right to complain now for those who support free trade in oil and for those who voted for it then to complain that the system worked as it was intended to The oil from the SPR was put on the global market which increased supply and brought prices down here at home Some of the oil sold by design onto the global market made its way to China This was not an unforeseen consequence The then majority on the Energy and Commerce Committee explicitly rejected a proposal by a Democratic member of the committee at the time Mr Green from Houston to license the export of crude oil the way we license LNG exports which requires the Department of Energy to approve the sales Requiring DOE approval on crude sales could have prevented the sales that are now of concern That said I appreciate that this is a step toward addressing those concerns But I am also concerned that this alone is insufficient and we need a more robust mechanism to address any sales of concern Certainly my colleagues on both sides of the aisle would be concerned about sales to North Korea or Iran or other adversaries That is why in the last Congress I supported my colleague from Pennsylvania Chrissy Houlahan s bipartisan bill that would have closed the loophole to allow the sale or export of oil from the SPR to foreign adversaries There is still work to do here and I hope that moving forward we can work together to craft smart energy policy that enhances our energy security and best serves the American people
504	Mr Speaker I rise today in support of H R 22 This morning I listened very carefully to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle talk about this bill many of whom I have great respect for their expertise in energy I have however heard terms like political political games partisan While this may be their perspective I wish for just a moment that we could transport all of us to my district to see the perspective there which is one of great hypocrisy On the one hand instead of utilizing the vast American resources we cleanly produce including in Utah the President chose to use this country s strategic reserve to try to lower prices On the other hand in fact the President did this while attacking energy jobs in Utah by suspending energy development on Federal lands and raising the royalty to produce oil two contributing factors to rising gas prices Not only did this release from the reserve barely make a dent in the cost of gas and weaken our national security but it also directly strengthened our number one geopolitical adversary China Under no circumstances should our reserve be used to fund our adversaries Regardless of our views in this Chamber on the use of the reserve by the Biden administration we should all agree our emergency supplies shouldn t be sent to our adversaries
505	Mr Speaker I thank the gentleman very much for his leadership and recognition that when we speak about this legislation and the question of blocking the utilization of the petroleum reserve during times of crisis we must raise a question Obviously having experienced a big freeze in Houston and the State of Texas where 151 people died we had to face the question of a very poor energy system a lack of access to fossil fuel I must admit a frozen nuclear system and being unprepared in terms of alternative energy It was a freeze that we had never experienced in Texas The idea of the utilization of the petroleum reserve for me is a national security issue and this legislation literally says if the President has the need and necessity to protect the American people it will not be allowed Mr Speaker I have to rise in opposition even coming from what has been called previously the energy capital of the world What we want to have in Houston and I believe in the Nation is a multidisciplined recognition that there is a climate crisis but at the same time recognizing the importance of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for in fact the necessities of the President to be able to provide for this Nation The American people are listening They want an executive who can make decisions that will block the Russians from absolutely crippling us They want a President who can utilize this reserve Today I stand against this legislation because it baffles me as to how we can undermine the President of the United States in serving the American people and providing for energy relief when necessary Mr Speaker I rise in opposition to H R 22 Protecting America s Strategic Petroleum Reserve From China Act It is critically important that we opposed the Republican effort to put together half baked solutions to nuanced energy policies This bill is yet another Republican attempt to appear tough on China and for them not taking responsibility for their misguided actions in 2015 when they reversed the 40 year ban on exporting crude oil including exporting to our foreign adversaries This bill does nothing to prevent the sale of oil to China whether from the strategic petroleum reserves or otherwise because American companies can simply buy the oil and sell it to China for a profit This legislation will result in unwarranted and unnecessary restraint on the ability of the president to act in a time of crisis or a national emergency We should not be passing legislation that will restrict the president s ability to help American working families as he did when he used the strategic petroleum reserves in response to Putin s illegal invasion of Ukraine If we really want to address this issue in a common sense and expansive manner then we should instead adopt the Democratic alternative to this ill conceived Republican bill now under consideration In the 117th Congress under the leadership of Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Pallone Jr D NJ the Democrats introduced the Buy Low and Sell High Act which would implement a comprehensive approach to protect American interests The Democrats Buy Low and Sell High Act not only bans the export of oil from the strategic petroleum reserves to China but it also bans sales to North Korea Russia Iran and any other country under U S sanctions If Republican s were serious about protecting and refilling the strategic petroleum reserves they would work with Democrats to pass the Buy Low and Sell High Act that advances a comprehensive approach to American energy policy We must take a wide ranging bipartisan and strong approach to ensure that the president can support all Americans and especially working class families during times of national energy crisis We must take a strong bipartisan approach to ensure that we do not allow our politics to cloud our judgment and hamstring the president s ability to bring down gas prices in times of need
506	Mr Speaker I rise in support of H R 22 This administration s war on American energy has sent energy costs through the roof While this administration has continued to shift blame for the rising prices President Biden is draining our Strategic Petroleum Reserve meant for emergencies by selling off some of these reserves in a Band Aid solution for his policy failures Since May of last year the Biden administration has sold off 1 million barrels of oil per day until after the midterm elections Thanks to President Biden s actions our oil reserve is now at the lowest point in 40 years Yet this administration has no plan to unleash American energy production to replenish our emergency oil supply and reduce prices To make matters even worse while the Biden administration is selling off our emergency oil reserve at an unprecedented rate some of these barrels of oil have gone to Communist China That is right Our emergency oil supply is now in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party We are exporting a total of 300 000 barrels of oil per day to China In part because of the Biden administration China not the U S has the largest government controlled stockpile of oil in the world With this legislation House Republicans are delivering on our promise to restore our Nation s energy security and better protect our national security This legislation stops the Biden administration from selling any more of our emergency supply to the Chinese Communist Party House Republicans will continue to stand up to China and stop the Biden administration from ceding our energy security to our enemies
507	Mr Speaker I thank the gentlewoman from Washington Mrs Rodgers chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and my dear friend for yielding and for bringing this legislation H R 22 to the floor It is such an important piece of legislation to start standing up for America s national security If you think about the Strategic Petroleum Reserve just think of the first word in that name strategic It is there for America s national security First of all raiding SPR as it is referred to President Biden has done over and over again depleting 40 percent of our national security strategic reserve not to move world oil prices As you can see Mr Speaker multiple times starting in November 2021 President Biden has raided SPR because he has attacked American energy As he attacked American energy starting on his first day in office the price of oil and gasoline at the pump subsequently has risen dramatically crushing middle class families So he started feeling the heat His answer should have been to reverse the failed policies that are dramatically increasing gas prices by crushing American energy That is not what President Biden did because the extremists on the left don t want that They won t allow him to do it Then he turned to SPR and he said well maybe we can just try to trick the American people by raiding SPR So he did When he raided it what happened You got a sugar high for about a week and boom the price started going back up again because the world markets recognized President Biden has taken American energy off the market By the way Mr Speaker we are the only country in the world that can produce massive quantities of oil that is a free market country The rest of the countries that have an abundant supply are cartels OPEC Russia Iran Venezuela They want a high price The only check and balance to high prices of oil is a free market producing America By the way if you want to hide behind the Green New Deal and global warming and whatever other names they attach to it climate change they change the name every couple of years because the American people figure out that all it is is an attack on American energy The price keeps going up because we are shutting off the cleanest producing country in the world Do you want to lower carbon emissions in the world Produce more oil in America It is not just about creating more jobs It is not just about our national security Mr Speaker It is about actually reducing global emissions This bill addresses President Biden selling our strategic reserves to China China is building about a new coal plant every week dramatically increasing carbon emissions while President Biden shuts down American manufacturing and production shuts down oil which by the way we were reducing emissions during those times when we were producing energy Over and over again raided SPR raided SPR raided SPR The price kept going up What went down is America s national security That is what we are getting to the heart of here 40 percent of our reserves We have two different ways to get energy We can actually produce it As the moniker right above the Speaker s rostrum says let us develop our natural resources We have natural resources We have the best technology in the world We can produce it cleaner than anybody else in the world As long as we are producing energy it actually can lower the cost We don t just produce enough for ourselves because by the way if we weren t allowed to export energy then you would see a decrease in production You would see a decrease in exploration It is like a farmer If a farmer can only produce and sell in America they are going to plant a lot less because they can t have access to world markets You want to have access to world markets but you want to also have a reserve in case not in case you have a failed policy as is what we are seeing with President Biden You want to reserve in case there is a natural disaster If a hurricane hits the Gulf of Mexico as we have seen it actually spikes the price so you have a brief disruption and you want a reserve to fill that need If you have some kind of national security emergency like they did in the 1970s by the way that is when SPR was created That is when we created this reserve for our country when cartels controlled world oil markets because we didn t have the technology to access like we do today We didn t have fracking technology We didn t have the ability to go 5 000 feet in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico to find billion barrel reserves like we do today The cartels controlled everything There were lines at the pump You had to have an even numbered license plate to get gasoline on a certain day That was the 1970s So Congress created SPR for our national security I understand a little history lesson might help people recognize how we got here It is not by accident that we got here We should want as Congress to be able to work together to fix this problem to address the fact that prices have gone up not just for gasoline at the pump but also when people are heating their homes in a cold winter The price shouldn t be that high By the way we were also by exporting energy helping our friends around the world so we don t have to be dependent on oil or natural gas from other places As was the case in the buildup to Afghanistan Putin was making about 700 million a day Mr Speaker selling his oil to America and Europe because President Biden shut off the American supply No reason that should have happened but that is what got us here What can get us out First let me remind you what else got us here because they are trying to blame everybody else under the Sun It is Putin s fault It is the oil companies fault It is the weather s fault It is President Biden s fault Day one he started mountains of rules and regulations These aren t laws passed by Congress by the way These are rules and regulations that have come out of the Biden administration just in the last 2 years attacking American energy not foreign countries President Biden was okay with pipelines from Russia to Europe but he said no on day one to a pipeline from Canada to America All of these actions had a cost The cost is dramatic prices at the pump for hardworking families crushing the lowest income families amongst us What agencies by the way are represented here The Department of Energy went after American energy and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission The Securities and Exchange Commission through woke policies went after American energy The Department of Agriculture yes went after American energy in these rules and regs The Council on Environmental Quality the Department of State that gets to the Keystone pipeline The Environmental Protection Agency the Department of Justice and yes the Department of the Interior all represented right here in rules and regulations that crushed American energy making us more dependent on foreign countries and leading to President Biden raiding our Strategic Petroleum Reserve 40 percent making our country less safe This foolishness has to end We can solve this problem Now Mrs McMorris Rodgers in her committee they actually have real ideas about how to solve this problem The good news is Mr Speaker under this majority we are going to be bringing bills through committee to the floor to fix this problem Now on the other side today you hear them talking about this magic bill They have got a bill Boy if we just killed this bill because they want to keep selling our strategic reserves to China 950 000 barrels already that President Biden has sold to China they have some magic answer My question would be Where was that magic answer 2 years ago 2 months ago 2 weeks ago when they were in the majority They had the House Senate and White House and I guess in the last 2 weeks they finally figured out the answer because they surely didn t pass that to the President 2 weeks ago 2 months ago or 2 years ago What they did do is they brought mountains and mountains of regulations to crush American energy Then Biden gets on a plane called Air Force One We have checked it there are no solar panels on the wings of Air Force One It actually uses jet fuel He flies to Saudi Arabia and begs Saudi princes to produce more energy because he shut down America s energy production No leases no pipelines no permits He has done all those things and it led to higher prices He didn t have to get on Air Force One and fly thousands of miles back and forth Who knows what the carbon footprint of that is I would love to see the press dig into that because they love talking about carbon footprints for other things He didn t have to get on Air Force One at all He could have picked up the phone and called Port Fourchon in Louisiana and said Will you produce more energy in America It is cleaner more efficient and there are better jobs than anywhere else in the world He didn t do that It is time we get smart policies It is time we have some common sense in our energy policy so we stop crushing those middle class families To sell our oil to China Not just our oil our reserves This is our piggy bank in case there is a disaster He has depleted 40 percent of it and he keeps reducing it to mask his failed policies Let s get the policy right and start fighting for those hardworking families who are suffering because of this Let s pass this legislation Let s keep going to work for those families
508	Mr Speaker I yield myself 1 minute I listened to the majority leader and I want to stress that history is not on his side The fact of the matter is that the Republicans created this problem by lifting the ban on the export of crude oil to China and the rest of the world when they were in the majority This bill does nothing to solve the problem Only 2 percent of the oil that is exported to China comes from the SPR Even if this bill passes which it won t in the Senate it will still allow the other 98 percent of crude oil to go to China The consequence of the Republican policy was to destroy jobs at American refineries including my home State of New Jersey because they allowed the crude oil to be exported and as a result a lot of the refineries closed and we lost jobs here Don t tell me that this is a bill that is going to help our country help jobs It is just the opposite It is just masking the reality which is they want to continue to sell oil to China to Russia to Iran and to all our adversaries Mr Speaker I reserve the balance of my time
509	Mr Speaker I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and I congratulate her on her historic leadership position Mr Speaker our Nation and our national security have always been tied to our ability to utilize the resources that we have right here in America to remain free The energy resources that are underneath the feet of my constituents were vital to the production and fueling of the tanks the planes and the ships that gave Americans the advantages that we needed to win World War II And now the Chinese Communist Party threatens free nations with oppression The Biden administration has allowed our Strategic Petroleum Reserve to be sold to Chinese companies for political purposes Instead of approving new leasing permits Biden delayed new drilling projects and canceled on day one the Keystone XL pipeline Instead of incentivizing companies to use the resources that we have in Pennsylvania Biden targeted American energy producers with new regulations that made natural gas and oil more expensive for American families Selling away our Strategic Petroleum Reserve for political gain has left our Nation less safe and our economy less secure Mr Speaker 950 000 barrels of American strategic petroleum to the Chinese Communist Party This boggles the American mind It is time to refill our strategic reserves It is time to stop risking our national security to score cheap political points I urge all of my colleagues to vote yes on this important legislation
510	Mr Speaker I thank the gentlewoman for yielding I am honored and blessed to be able to serve with you Instead of supporting American energy producers and reversing their disastrous energy policies the Biden administration decided to drain our energy reserves to the lowest levels since 1983 So who benefited from this decision to drain these reserves The Chinese Communist Party now has the largest government controlled petroleum reserve in the world In fact this administration transferred 900 000 barrels from our stockpile to a subsidy of the Chinese Communist Party owned China Petroleum Chemical Corporation H R 22 sponsored by Mr. Speaker McMorris Rodgers bars the Secretary of Energy from selling any of America s petroleum reserves to an entity affiliated with the CCP or any entity that intends to export it to China Energy security is national security House Republicans are fighting to ensure one of our greatest geopolitical challengers China does not benefit from this administration s misguided energy policies I urge passage of H R 22 the Protecting America s Strategic Petroleum Reserve from China Act
511	Mr Speaker I rise in support of H R 22 The bottom line is do we sell our Strategic Petroleum Reserve to China or not The answer is we should never sell one ounce of our Strategic Petroleum Reserve to the communist country of China Remember Joe Biden as a candidate on day one declared war on American energy by shutting down the Keystone XL pipeline He still commits to the war on American energy We in America are paying way more for energy than we should because of the policies of this administration H R 22 Mr Speaker is an easy one The United States of America should not sell one ounce of our Strategic Petroleum Reserve to the communist country of China Mr Speaker I rise in strong support of H R 22
512	Mr Speaker I have paid attention to the SPR since 2008 when I got elected to the Texas House As you know 60 percent of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is housed in my district I am pleased to announce that the Independent Petroleum Association of America endorses this legislation put forth by House Republicans aimed at reining in the administration s misuse of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve or SPR as we call it The SPR was not intended to be used as a political tool to bring down gasoline prices in an election year Next thing you know the President will be giving away free college tuition Oh he did that too This is only a Band Aid on the overarching situation The long term solution is to enhance rather than hinder America s leadership in natural gas and oil production Our true domestic natural gas and oil reserves from production to pipelines and through the supply chain are ready to work and Republicans legislation puts them and our American allies at the forefront
513	Mr Speaker I yield myself 30 seconds It certainly is no surprise that the oil industry would support this bill because this bill does absolutely nothing to prevent them from selling to China and to Russia and all our adversaries Only 2 percent of the oil that is sold to China comes from the SPR so they will continue to be able to sell to whoever they please Mr Speaker I reserve the balance of my time
514	Mr Speaker I thank the chairwoman for yielding We are proud of you and I look forward to working with you You guys have got to be kidding me Seriously You were in control You had the House You had the Senate You had the Presidency If you thought there were any good bills or good ideas to stop this or bills that were better than anything we are putting forward why didn t you do them You had the control You didn t need us for a whole lot of other things You voted and rammed through things that we didn t want rammed things through that were radical and yet this commonsense type of legislation nothing happened You can t be serious That is a bad argument Since there has been one party rule in Washington Democratic rule Republicans were forced to watch President Biden drain more than 250 million barrels nearly 40 percent 40 percent of our petroleum reserve This puts our national security at risk It puts the American people at risk For our military what will they do if they need the petroleum reserve For Americans what will they do when natural disasters strike and their town needs the petroleum reserve For our rescue and emergency personnel what will they do if they need the petroleum reserve Why would anyone ever vote against this bill Maybe if you want to lower gas prices temporarily for political gain you would oppose this bill Make a choice Do what is right Vote for this bill
515	Mr Speaker I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas Ms De La Cruz Ms De La CRUZ Mr Speaker I rise in support of American energy independence and the oil and natural gas workers of south Texas This act is a crucial step to holding China accountable and repositioning the United States as a global energy leader It is essential that we recover our energy independence and stand up for Texas workers who have unfairly suffered as a result of this administration s misguided policies that have emboldened regimes like China and Venezuela s narco dictatorship The decision to prioritize a foreign energy over our own puts American workers our industries and our country at a disadvantage Protecting American energy will strengthen both our economic and national security I stand fully committed to fighting for all the natural gas and oil workers in south Texas and across our Nation
516	Mr Speaker I had prepared a speech today to talk about my support for H R 22 and the protection of our Strategic Petroleum Reserves But after hearing my colleagues on the left it is very simple They don t care about unleashing American energy us getting to energy dominance to ensuring that we have the global currency They care about defending the Chinese and the CCP That is why they have continued to try and prevent us from being able to sell our strategic petroleum reserves from China That is why they tried to stop us from putting together a subcommittee that would have been a select subcommittee to go after the CCP and their malign activities Mr Speaker it is very clear They do not want to go to an America first agenda They do not want to protect America They do not want to unleash American energy for the American people to get our costs under control They want to continue to protect the communist China party and the Chinese themselves I rise in protection not just in support of H R 22 but of the American people and the American workers
517	Mr Speaker I rise today as a co sponsor of Protecting America s Strategic Petroleum Reserve from China Act China should not be the beneficiary of the Biden administration s foolhardy abuse of the SPR It was at 695 million barrels and it goes down to 371 That is halved while the Chinese Communist Party has in reserve nearly a billion This is foolhardy This is an excellent piece of legislation and I urge swift passage Let s put America first
518	Mr Speaker I yield myself 30 seconds The gentleman talks about how China has built up its reserves its petroleum reserves It is because you when you were in the majority stopped the ban on export and they used that opportunity to build up their reserves This has nothing to do with the SPR Mr Speaker 98 percent of the oil that is exported to China is not from the SPR So they used the opportunity since 2015 when you lifted the ban to build up their petroleum reserves on your watch Mr Speaker I reserve the balance of my time
519	Mr Speaker the bottom line is America needs to be energy independent We should not be relying on foreign governments We should not be relying on China least of all Mr Speaker 60 percent of New Yorkers for instance rely on natural gas We need to expand our energy portfolio We need to increase domestic production of energy We need to protect our reserves We should not be engaging in the type of behavior that the administration has with respect to China and we should continue to do everything we can to reduce the cost of energy here in America and increase our production That has to be the goal at all times
520	Mr Speaker I am prepared to close and I yield myself the balance of my time Mr Speaker I find myself compelled to point out that listening to Republican arguments today you would think that they have been sacred stewards of the SPR and that couldn t be further from the truth In fact when Republicans had the majority in both the House and the Senate from 2015 to 2019 they passed six bills none of which had anything to do with energy that raided the SPR for a total of 260 million barrels of crude Now the Republicans stand here criticizing President Biden s usage of the SPR and it is laughable President Biden s usage of the SPR has helped lower gas prices by nearly 1 80 per gallon since their peak While the Republicans want to pretend they are tough on China it is really the opposite that is true Last year the Biden administration was forced to sell 20 million barrels from the SPR under one of those laws that I mentioned earlier that passed a Republican controlled Congress The Republicans didn t include any restrictions no restrictions or stipulations on that sale and as a result the administration was forced to sell to the highest bidders including a firm owned by the People s Republic of China Again I am going to stress in closing the Republicans caused China to have a huge petroleum reserve by lifting the ban on crude oil in 2015 when they were in the majority Prior to 2015 when the Republicans lifted the ban on exports of crude oil we had that ban in place for 40 years 40 years and then in 2015 they came in and they lifted the ban so they caused this problem During the Trump administration the amount of crude oil that was sold to China was unbelievable As a result the petroleum reserve you know increased significantly in China They took advantage of the situation Now if you really wanted to do something today first of all you would say that the SPR should not only be banned by selling oil from the SPR to China but you should say that you can t sell it to Russia You can t sell it to Iran You can t sell it to North Korea You can t sell it to our adversaries which is exactly what the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania Ms Houlahan s bill does on a bipartisan basis But even beyond that you could simply say no crude oil should be sold at all exported at all or certainly not exported to our adversaries and that is not what is happening here So this is a problem that was created by the Republicans and they pretend that they are doing something about it today but in fact they are not The reason is because they are with the Big Oil They are with the special interests that want to sell this crude oil continue to sell it overseas and they don t care that it goes to our adversaries That is the bottom line This bill is not going to accomplish anything and so I would urge my colleagues to vote no on the legislation Mr Speaker I yield back the balance of my time
521	Mr Speaker I yield myself the balance of my time Leadership matters American leadership matters You can t be a diplomatic power without being a military power You can t be a military power without being an economic power You cannot be an economic power without energy In order to reverse the damage to our energy security and our global leadership we must flip the switch and unleash American energy production We need to stop the Biden administration from wasting our strategic reserves It is time to cut the red tape and expand energy production here at home modernize our infrastructure and create new opportunities for jobs and economic development The Democrats suggested if the bill included Iran Russia and North Korea that they would support it The fact of the matter is those are the countries this administration has gone to They have gone to OPEC Iran and Russia and actually asked them to produce more oil Mr Speaker I look forward to the passage of this bill today and I am eager I am eager to work with my colleagues on additional solutions to make energy more affordable more reliable It is America that is leading in clean reliable renewable affordable energy and it is so important to energy dominance It is important to American leadership It is important to our economy It is important to every person in this country that has been living with record high energy prices Every time they go to the gas station to fill up over the last couple of years they have been experiencing record high energy prices Mr Speaker we are prepared to lead We want to unleash American energy unleash clean American energy jobs This is important to our national security It is important to our economic security I urge everyone to vote yes Pass H R 22 It is just the beginning There is more to come Mr Speaker I yield back the balance of my time
522	Mr Speaker it is my honor to stand in this well and represent the people of Michigan s 13th Congressional District Last week for the first time in 100 years the House failed to organize on opening day As a new Member of Congress I found it to be a sad day for this body as an institution a sad day for democracy and a sad day for the American people Mr Speaker House Democrats are united and prepared to try to find common ground with the other side of the aisle to solve problems on behalf of the American people but I am not sure if I will find a willing partner across the aisle because of extreme viewpoints The start of the 118th Congress has in its short time of existence seen some sad days These sad days must stop now Let s get to work
523	Mr. Speaker today I congratulate my alma mater the University of Georgia on their dominating victory over the TCU Horned Frogs in Monday s national championship Last year the Bulldogs ended a four decade long national championship drought This year they became the first team in the playoff era to win back to back titles Coach Kirby Smart has built an incredible program with incredible players several of which are from Georgia s 14th District Ladd McConkey a graduate of North Murray High School in Murray County Georgia has started as wide receiver for two seasons at UGA During his time as a Bulldog he has amassed over 1 300 total yards and 15 total touchdowns two of which came on Monday night Ladd is not the only outstanding player from Georgia 14 Tate Ratledge of Rome Smael Mondon Jr of Dallas Cole Speer of Calhoun CJ Washington of Cedartown Jonathan Washburn of Ringgold and Cade Brock from Darlington School have all made our district proud Go Dawgs

526	Mr. Speaker with news that Damar Hamlin has finally been released from the hospital I am honored to join my fellow NFL alumni Congressman Owens and my colleagues here today to lead a moment recognizing Damar Hamlin s inspiring story on the floor of the people s House Football has some downsides but it also has the power to bring us together to remind us of what really matters Damar s perseverance has inspired millions and once again highlighted the generosity and fundamental goodness of the American people Damar congratulations on your recovery We are all with you Mr. Speaker I yield to the gentleman from Utah Mr Owens
527	Mr. Speaker I thank my teammate for pulling this together Damar Hamlin s fighting spirit and his faith inspired all Americans His miraculous recovery has reminded us of the power of prayer He has been in the prayers of millions over the last 2 weeks his teammates his opponents and Americans throughout our country regardless of race creed or color As we stand on the House floor today we see the vision of our Founders a promise to become a more perfect Union It is a celebration of meritocracy of a young man whose strength comes from God and his family We have seen our Nation s heart of empathy one that blesses us with the opportunity to dream to struggle to overcome and the ultimate prize to inspire and bless others God bless Damar the Hamlin family his teammates and the entire football community
528	Mr. Speaker I rise today to honor and celebrate the life of C Lee Butler of Savannah Georgia Lee was born in Chicago in 1926 and graduated from New Trier High School in Winnetka Illinois in 1944 Five days after his 18th birthday he enlisted in the U S Army and served on the Italian front in World War II While in law school at Northwestern University Lee met and married Betty Stanley Lee and Betty have four children Darsey Julia Malcolm and Margaret In 1970 Lee founded his own business the Fiduciary Services Corporation now the Fiduciary Group a successful investment management firm Lee served at Memorial Medical Center and on the board of St Joseph s Hospital of Savannah He was a member of Wesley Monumental United Methodist Church since first coming to Savannah in 1957 On behalf of myself and the entire First District of Georgia we are sorry for the loss of this great American
529	Mr. Speaker Buffalo and western New York have had our fair share of challenges over the last year A racist mass shooter murdered innocent people at a local grocery store A blinding blizzard took the lives of dozens of our neighbors 2 weeks ago And what should have been an exciting Monday night football game turned into a nightmare for Buffalo Bills player Damar Hamlin and his family Our community is grateful Damar is recovering at home with his family now Today I rise to celebrate the people and the spirit of Buffalo We are more than neighbors we are family We are a family that sticks together works together and rallies around our teams and one another in good times and in bad Mr. Speaker I am proud of the way Buffalo works through our struggles and prouder still to call this place with a big heart home Our best days are immediately in front of us Go Bills
530	Mr. Speaker earlier this week the Biden administration announced plans to ban gas stoves The Governor of New York embraced the same plan The problem is that 60 percent of New Yorkers rely on natural gas and 70 percent of our electricity is generated by natural gas While we absolutely embrace the move to reduce carbon emissions the reality is natural gas has reduced carbon emissions far greater than renewables over the last two decades We need a comprehensive energy plan and portfolio that is an all of the above approach We need clean cheap reliable energy Natural gas plays a critical role in doing that To try and ban natural gas and force homeowners to convert their home from gas to electric the average homeowner will pay 35 000 to do that The question for the President and the Governor of New York is Who will pay for that
531	Mr. Speaker it is the honor of a lifetime to represent the people of North Carolina s 13th District While we have seen chaos and confusion play out in this very Chamber over the past week I want to make it clear that I am here to solve problems and not get caught up in politics as usual It is important for the American people to know that there are adults in the room and reasonable minds will prevail I am committed to working across the aisle to do what is right for North Carolina North Carolina s 13th District is one of the fastest growing districts in the country and Congress needs to address the challenges that come with that growth My constituents need their tax dollars to be used responsibly to improve roads and bridges They need solutions that bring down the cost of housing and childcare We need immigration reform that allows our economy to prosper Mr. Speaker I support immigration reform that includes a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented immigrants known as the Dreamers along with robust border security From Apex to Goldsboro my district has a diverse set of needs and priorities and the time for action is now
532	Mr. Speaker on Monday classified documents were discovered at President Biden s think tank in Washington D C These documents were at least 6 years old meaning the President had them and took them while he was Vice President and lacked the authority at the time to declassify them Yesterday a second batch of documents has been found The timing of these discoveries right after the November midterm elections is I am sure coincidental Knowing the history of the Biden family s shady dealings with China and others this raises serious national security concerns Mishandling classified information is a serious offense yet the Democrats from Hillary Clinton to Joe Biden seem to get a pass When Republicans are accused of doing far less we get special prosecutions and political witch hunts for a long time This breach of national security should be immediately investigated by Congress and the DOJ to determine the magnitude of this offense If the DOJ wants to claim to be non partisan it must start enforcing with equity across party lines Who has seen these documents Who has had access to them with the sloppy storage that we saw in Pennsylvania or wherever else they are This is a very dangerous precedent and the Vice President or the President need to be held accountable
533	Mr. Speaker I rise today to praise President Biden for his work to restore our economy The COVID 19 pandemic caused economic issues that few experts could have predicted It needed strong leadership to help our Nation recover Thanks to President Biden s leadership inflation has come down for six straight months gasoline prices are down almost 2 in a few months and the cost of goods are falling nationwide These actions are saving millions of dollars for hardworking American families across the country In addition President Biden s leadership has led to increased wages 11 million new jobs and the lowest unemployment in 50 years Clearly President Biden s economic policies are working and we are lucky to have him in the White House
534	Mr. Speaker the rent is too damn high The rent is too damn high We have people across the country struggling to keep a roof over their heads We are the wealthiest Nation in the history of the world outside of ancient African civilizations yet we cannot provide housing for every single person in our country We have CEOs making record profits We have corporations making record profits We have corporate landlords suppressing and oppressing and evicting tenants without just cause while continuing to raise the rent We call on President Biden to take executive action on this issue We do not have a healthy democracy or a healthy society unless we take care of our tenants and our working class people who are working 40 50 60 70 hours a week just to survive
535	Mr. Speaker it is an honor to be here serving as Illinois 17th Congressional District trusted neighbor in Congress I spent more than 20 years of my life as a broadcast meteorologist making sure that people had the right information to make good decisions in times of dangerous weather Now I am here in Congress to serve my constituents as their trusted voice in government I am focused on delivering results for my constituents whether it is lowering food energy or prescription drug costs increasing good paying jobs in our communities or protecting access to reproductive healthcare I promise to work with anyone on either side of the aisle Democrat or Republican on commonsense solutions that solve the problems central and northwestern Illinois families face every day I am ready to put partisan politics aside and get to work in the 118th Congress
536	Mr. Speaker America s economic independence is based in energy independence Today I voted for H R 22 a bill that prohibits selling oil from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve to China However this bill does not go far enough I was one of the Members that saved the Strategic Petroleum Reserve with my vote several years ago We have to do more to prohibit the sale of oil to other tyrants who wage war on peaceful people and nations In 2015 it was the Republican controlled Congress that voted to begin exporting oil to all of our biggest adversaries Iran North Korea Russia and China included Well how about that Americans cannot be dependent on any foreign adversaries for our way of life Now more than ever is the time to ensure American energy independence in perpetuity We protect our workers and our companies when we stand up to predatory adversaries We must continue to keep advancing new energy technologies here at home and I look forward to Republican support in doing so That is the recipe for American strength and liberty
537	Mr. Speaker let me first of all acknowledge Damar Hamlin for his courage and his fight to survive Welcome home as he is discharged from a Buffalo hospital so that he can recover That is the kind of strength that represents America and though I am not from Buffalo let me salute the Buffalo Bills I rise today Mr. Speaker to speak about the child and to ask America How does a 6 year old shoot a teacher From the research from the University of Pennsylvania the answer is that children become shooters because they have access to guns So in my congressional year 2023 I am going to demand that this Congress claims this as the Year of the Child As a founder of the Congressional Children s Caucus I am going to call upon my Democrat and Republican colleagues to join this caucus to be able to establish the premise that no child should go to bed hungry no child should be without housing or good education and no child should get off a school bus and be shot as two children were in Washington D C Stop the gun violence Let this be the Year of the Child Let us lift up our children so they can be healthy adults
538	Mr. Speaker I rise to discuss the Protecting America s Strategic Petroleum Reserve from China Act which the Republicans brought to the floor today to fix a mistake that their leadership in the 114th Congress made You wouldn t know that Mr. Speaker to hear them talking today of blaming other people and not themselves Back then 235 Republicans voted to end our country s 40 year long crude oil export ban When they did that Trump took full advantage of it and under his administration over 391 million barrels went to China Now they want to rewrite history You can t rewrite the history The evidence is there This bill was a step in the right direction But like my colleague from Ohio said earlier It doesn t go far enough Why don t we extend this ban to North Korea Iran and Russia That way we can prevent all our adversaries and not just China from using our oil to our disadvantage
539	Mr. Speaker I rise today to recognize two of my most important constituents and the milestones in the week to come This Sunday January 15 marks the 12th anniversary with my husband Ian Silverii Twelve years ago I said yes to our first date and it was the best decision I have made I am so grateful for his love and support all along the way No matter how difficult our paths have been he has always been my rock and biggest cheerleader I am thankful every day for the life we have built together Happy anniversary to my partner and best friend and the dad to my other most important constituent my son Davis January 19 is my son s third birthday Davis has been the greatest gift to both of our lives It has been amazing to watch him grow and to see him become the loving and empathetic little guy that he is Nothing makes me happier and prouder than being his mom His Dad and I love him so much I can t wait to celebrate him and all that he brings to our lives and the people around him Happy birthday to my sweet boy
540	Mr. Speaker I rise on behalf of eastern North Carolina Nearly 100 000 eastern North Carolinians do not have access to affordable healthcare placing them in the Medicaid coverage gap Mr. Speaker more than a decade after the passage of the Affordable Care Act 12 States have declined to expand coverage This is simply unacceptable That is why one of my first acts as a Member of Congress included cosponsoring H R 31 the COVER Now Act This bill introduced by my good friend Lloyd Doggett of Texas is a critical piece of legislation that would allow local authorities to provide health benefits to residents of States that have not expanded Medicaid Mr. Speaker the hardworking people of eastern North Carolina make up more than 20 percent of our State and we must do all that we can to keep them safe and healthy
541	Mr. Speaker I rise today for the first time as a Member of Congress to thank the folks back home in Cincinnati and throughout the First Congressional District I couldn t be more energized to be serving all of you and the country that we love My commitment to you and my new colleagues Mr. Speaker is to be here as a new transparent bipartisan and highly reliable leader We are already working with Republicans on legislative priorities that will help our children and families back home to cap the costs of insulin for children to help folks pay their bills with an expanded earned income tax credit and a child tax credit and to provide additional grants to communities to recruit more police officers and firefighters There will always be more that unites us than divides us My work will continue to find common ground working across the aisle to get things done on the issues that matter most to us
542	Mr. Speaker last November the American people delivered a clear message Women want the right to make their own reproductive decisions My Republican colleagues must have missed that message because they just passed a bill that inserts politics into private family decisions That bill is an attempt to create a false and gruesome narrative to interfere with a doctor s care for her patients and to falsely suggest that doctors don t already have a legal obligation to provide the best possible care for their patients This fearmongering is dangerous It could leave doctors fearful of providing the best care for patients who are facing devastating circumstances It could cause further pain to families facing the heartbreak of a fetus with a fatal abnormality The real aim of this bill is to vilify and punish women and their doctors I voted no on H R 26 I will continue to stand up for women s reproductive rights
543	Mr. Speaker I wish to congratulate the nurses of Mount Sinai and Monetfiore Medical Center who after 3 days on strike reached a tentative agreement for safe staffing ratios this morning Our hospitals are facing extreme nursing shortages and it is affecting patient care Montefiore Medical Center which is in my district has had 760 vacancies But thanks to the tentative agreement and the courage and efforts of our nurses on the picket line hospital management is now committing to an aggressive hiring plan and to immediately implement staffing ratios including an increase of over 170 nursing positions and a 19 1 percent wage increase and additional benefits to help with retention I thank so much the New York State Nurses Association NYSNA for their work It is our privilege to stand in solidarity with them
544	Mr. Speaker I rise to commemorate Korean American Day tomorrow I am proud to represent Koreatown in Los Angeles the largest Korean American community of any congressional district in the country Tomorrow we recognize the landmark 120th anniversary of the arrival of the first Korean American immigrants to the United States and we honor the enduring legacy sacrifices and contributions made by generations of Korean Americans This is why I urge my colleagues to support my resolution to recognize the ideals of Korean American Day and essential contributions of Korean Americans to American life Mr. Speaker it is a great honor to represent a community whose history and culture are so valuable both individually and as a part of our larger diverse American identity Since coming to Congress I ve made it a priority to ensure the Korean American community gets the awareness and support it deserves That is why I ve pushed Congress to recognize the sacrifices of Korean and Korean American veterans throughout the last century It is why I recently fought to secure 7 million for the creation of the Korean American National Museum the first museum in the nation dedicated to honoring over a century of Korean American history and culture And it s why I am leading this year s efforts to recognize the monumental milestone of 120 years of Korean American culture and the countless contributions Korean Americans have made to our country As I continue to work every day to represent and uplift the Korean American community in Los Angeles I am grateful for the continued partnership of Korean American organizations in my district The Korean American Federation of Los Angeles led by President James An has and will continue to serve as a powerful voice and strong advocate for Korean Americans in the Los Angeles area Their programs and services help form the backbone of Koreatown and have helped keep the community together and strong overcoming decades of challenges discrimination and titanic changes in our city The Koreatown Youth and Community Center led by their Executive Director Johng Ho Song has spent nearly half a decade serving at risk youth in Los Angeles as the leading multiservice organization in Koreatown Their support for Korean American youth and their families especially recent immigrants and the economically disadvantaged is essential in ensuring everyone in Koreatown has access to healthcare housing and education These organizations and many others like them are essential to sustaining and strengthening Los Angeles Korean community and I am privileged to work alongside them every day to make sure Koreatown and all Korean Americans get the support they deserve from our federal government This Korean American Day I hope all my colleagues constituents and fellow Americans take the time to reflect on and fully honor the continuing positive influence and impact the Korean American community has on our Country
545	Mr. Speaker when the Supreme Court overturned Roe last summer they took away hard fought rights from millions of women across our country Now women in Kentucky no longer have access to safe and legal abortions even in cases of rape and incest The country responded at the ballot box and my district overwhelmingly rejected a constitutional amendment to further restrict reproductive rights in Kentucky So how do we respond here Last night the House Republicans first order of business was to make it even harder for women to receive abortions and for healthcare professionals to provide them These decisions are best left between a woman and her doctor But House Republicans have sent a clear message that more legislative attacks against women s rights are on the horizon I proudly voted against yesterday s attack on women and their doctors and I will continue fighting for reproductive rights
546	Mr. Speaker I am grateful for the time to address the House Isn t it outstanding Mr. Speaker to see the people s House open once again to the public have the public in our galleries and see the Capitol open to our families That is a big change after the years of the pandemic and our Chamber being closed from the citizens and families who send us here to Washington So that is a great way to have seen this House under Republican majority leadership open the week As we close this first week under Republican leadership back in the majority on this House floor it is also good to see my colleagues on the other side of the aisle put a premium on talking about bipartisanship I particularly like my friend from Ohio Mr Landsman and Mr Sorensen of Illinois two new freshman Members on the House floor for the first time this week as fully sworn Members of Congress talking about their priorities as newly elected Democrats and seeking bipartisanship on this side of the aisle This week the House has taken two important steps regarding our strategic competition with the Chinese Communist Party the CCP and Mr. Speaker those steps on this House floor were overwhelmingly bipartisan First we created a Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the CCP which is our vision of an integrated open and free world where people can celebrate their religion people can travel and people can trade That strategic competition presses the Western values of Europe and the United States with the more narrow and authoritarian view of the Chinese Communist Party Secondly we prevented oil being released from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve and that being sold to Communist China Today over 320 Members of this body agreed with that by voting yes on H R 22 The Strategic Petroleum Reserve has played an important role in U S energy and national security policy for four decades It was created in response to the Arab oil embargo in the early 1970s which resulted in the tripling of oil prices at the time Since that time the SPR has remained a backstop for the United States in case of oil supply disruption Mr. Speaker those on the other side of the aisle talked about America becoming the largest exporting nation in the world and that somehow that is a bad thing and that we freed our ability to export oil and gas outside the U S as if that were a bad thing It is not They are two completely different issues The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is there for an emergency affecting the United States our citizens our households our industry principally in case of a Gulf hurricane or a disruption in a pipeline or in some other aspect of oil and gas disruption from war or an accident somewhere in the world It is not meant to be supplying oil per se to everybody besides the United States Just over the last year President Biden has released 180 million barrels of our Strategic Petroleum Reserve bringing it down to a 1985 level a four decade low This is not smart economic policy or energy policy in this country In fact Mr. Speaker over 1 million barrels went to a Chinese affiliated company At the same time China is reportedly holding its own crude oil reserves of 900 million barrels Anyone with realistic knowledge and expectations in and around the debate about climate change or energy policy knows that this administration s energy policies have hurt American families and put our economy at risk while at the same time weakening the globe s interest in fighting climate change President Biden s failed policies to shut down the Keystone XL pipeline deny permits discourage new drilling discourage new pipeline construction and through his bank and securities environmental social and governance policies so called ESG policies that too has discouraged badly needed capital investment to go to our energy industry and has weakened American global leadership and our strategic benefit as referenced by my friends on the other side of the aisle of energy independence President Biden has weakened our energy independence Instead the Biden administration has doubled down even tripled down on these bad policies that have not only raised costs on every American but do nothing in the long run to impact climate While President Biden s nanny state regulators this week considered outlawing your gas stove in your home or in your kitchen or your restaurant Republicans on this House floor began their first step at unleashing an all of the above energy strategy We have to let that sink in that a Federal regulator actually considered a serious policy proposal of banning you from having a gas stove in your home or in your restaurant I mean everyone in America was shaking their heads this week with the preposterous nature of that new idea from the Biden administration Republicans believe in an all of the above strategy which benefits America and benefits the globe and we must continue to invest in energy development in order to make it through a full global transition First we have to keep investing in natural gas We have natural gas fields across our Nation from the West Coast to the East Coast in the heart of Pennsylvania and of course in the heart of New York State where New York State s Democratic leadership refuses to let that be brought online let that be developed benefiting the New York tax base New York workers and New York consumers That gas field just in Pennsylvania and New York alone Mr. Speaker some believe it is larger and more lucrative than the largest gas field that we know of in Qatar in the Persian Gulf Yet we will never see a pipeline from Pennsylvania to East Coast ports under this administration and possibly under any other future Democratic leadership If the war in Ukraine showed Europe and the world anything anything it is that Russia cannot be trusted any longer if they were ever to be a reliable source to Europe for their energy consumption needs The United States stands ready to export more liquefied natural gas to Europe but the pipelines and other infrastructure don t fully exist in this country in order to have that impact to help our allies and partners in Europe and Asia in the short run We need to make that investment Second I have a solution for Democrats that should meet all of their objectives for world energy reliance and consistent with their climate objectives It is clean it is renewable and we can export it to developing nations nuclear energy International financial institutions like the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will not or are very reluctant to finance any nuclear power expansion in Europe yet the countries of Central Europe are demanding it They want that energy diversity They want an all of the above energy strategy Yet the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in which the United States is a shareholder turns a blind eye to clean renewable dependable nuclear energy The EBRD insists on financing green energy projects to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars yet ignores this commonsense all of the above strategy Today s reactor designs are not the plants of yesteryear They are not the plants of lore at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania or Chernobyl They are safe and reliable For many the top concern has been what we do with nuclear waste Research in recent years has significantly advanced and today we have the ability to recycle nuclear waste components to produce even more abundant energy Nuclear power plants in France have the ability to do this but we don t currently do it here in the U S Recently I visited Entergy s Nuclear One facility in Russellville Arkansas and saw the nuclear waste byproducts that could be repurposed for future energy needs Further I learned that the process to lengthen the life of an existing nuclear plant here in the United States much less build a new one is an immense tangle of regulatory red tape that takes years to navigate and millions of dollars of out of pocket fees We in Congress can do a better job streamlining that kind of review When America leads in research and development that knowledge and the resulting benefits are exported around the world We can only export that success if we have the successful policies in place to spur that development We cannot expect the developing nations in Africa Southeast Asia or here in the Western Hemisphere to power their growing cities and their growing in wealth populations by wind and solar alone principally because the issues with storage deficiencies and production of energy from renewables efficiencies that remain while improving in the years ahead Solely depending on that is unrealistic When America does not have the will to export this kind of R D those countries will turn to bad economic actors like China and Russia Energy policy is a long term investment in the needs of not only our future but around the globe Our globe needs 100 million barrels equivalent per day to power our homes and our economies As more and more countries develop and their people grow in wealth and prosperity their energy needs will rise Mr. Speaker not shrink We cannot wait and have nothing to offer and we certainly don t want to impose California s energy policies on the world and expect a good outcome We should be investing in all of our energy options That is why House Republicans in the weeks ahead just as we started out here in our first week will be bringing policies to this House floor to unleash an all of an above energy strategy oil natural gas nuclear and of course renewables like wind and solar They all play a part The mistakes of our policies today under this President mean we don t have the energy capacity and dependability that we need not only today but tomorrow This unleashing policy by House Republicans not only puts America first but it puts families across the globe first first in opportunity first in food and fuel security and first in prosperity Appreciating the Public Service of Anushree Jumde

554	Mr. Speaker and still I rise to quote Maya Angelou Bringing the gifts my ancestors gave I am the dream and the hope of the slave I rise today as a proud descendent of enslaved people a proud descendent of the foundational mothers and fathers of this country They are foundational because they helped to build the infrastructure that allowed this great country to become the great Nation that it is There were many others who contributed to this country but they by the millions contributed and their lives were sacrificed such that we might have the great Nation that we have today I rise today to talk specifically about a conscience agenda A conscience agenda is one that I believe can be embraced by all people of good will A conscience agenda I have before you and me some of what would be included in a conscience agenda and I will give a brief explanation about each I will set the stage by explaining some of what Dr King called to our attention with reference to this question of the conscience In speaking to a group of clergy and laypeople concerned about the Vietnam war on February 6 1968 in Washington D C Dr King concluded his speech with some very powerful language that addresses the role that conscience plays in doing some things and taking certain positions Dr King s final words were On some positions cowardice asks the question is it safe I will add parenthetically here is it okay for me to do this or will I be harmed in some way physically Cowardice will ask you is it safe to do this He goes on to say Expediency asks the question is it politic Does it make good political sense to do what I am about to do He further indicates Vanity asks the question is it popular If I do this will I have a parade in my honor Will there be people who will celebrate what I am about to do or what I am doing Dr King concludes with this But conscience asks the question is it right He goes on to say And there comes a time when one must take the position that is neither safe nor politic nor popular but he must take it because conscience tells him it is right I am not sure that it is safe politic or popular to take a position on all of these issues and I am not sure that it is not safe nor politic nor popular but I do say this Conscience tells me that I should do this There is a moral imperative to bring these issues before the Congress of the United States of America and I do so because conscience tells me it is the right thing to do I believe that as a matter of conscience we should have a Slavery Remembrance Day I understand that this day is one that ought to be commemorated Unlike many other days that we celebrate we must commemorate this day There can be some celebration of the lives of those who were lost to slavery but this is a day for commemoration principally As a day of commemoration I believe that we ought to let the world know how much we appreciate those millions of people who were enslaved many of whom were born into slavery lived as slaves and died as slaves It is time for this country to show some appreciation for them For too long we have revered the enslavers and reviled the enslaved This conscience agenda would have us recognize Slavery Remembrance Day and August 20 of 1619 is the date that the first enslaved people were brought to this country It was on that day in Point Comfort that a slave ship the White Lion landed It brought with it some 20 odd as it is said enslaved persons They were introduced to the English speaking colonies in this country Twenty human beings were stolen kidnapped and brought to our country They were brought to our country and traded just as you would trade a horse or you would trade some piece of machinery They were traded human beings on August 20 1619 traded into slavery into this country This is the day that we have set aside to recognize as Slavery Remembrance Day because that day set into motion events that haunt us to this day We ought not forget that date August 20 1619 I am so proud to tell you that this House has already passed a resolution honoring the persons who were enslaved This House passed a resolution Some 218 Members of this House voted in support of Slavery Remembrance Day This was already a part of the annals and the history of the House It is therefore those who look through the vista of time at this time to understand what happened I can t explain it all today because I have much to say but I will tell you that I am proud to tell you in fact that the President of the United States of America the Honorable Joe Biden a man that I have great respect for I support him I have supported him I support him today I will support him tomorrow because of what he has done this President recognized Slavery Remembrance Day with a statement that he issued on August 20 of 2022 In the many things that he has indicated in this statement I will just focus on a very few words some seven words that are contained within this statement He indicated Great nations don t hide from their history He said much more but it is important for us to accentuate this statement Great nations don t hide from their history There are too many people in this country to this day who would have us hide from our history have our history be proclaimed involuntary relocation That is what is happening in the State of Texas currently we have a group of folks who want to proclaim slavery the enslavement of human beings as involuntary relocation We cannot hide from our history There are people who don t want it taught in schools They want us to somehow give a rendition of history that reveres those who were the enslavers and revile those who were the enslaved For too long this has been the case in this country It is my desire and my belief that people of conscience that the conscience dictates that there is a moral imperative for us to change this misunderstanding of history To do this we obviously need a Slavery Remembrance Day In Houston Texas on August 20 2022 we had an event a Slavery Remembrance Day event A thousand people showed up for Slavery Remembrance Day including our mayor Sylvester Turner Many notable members of the clergy were in attendance Our city council people were in attendance State representative Ron Reynolds was there We had commissioner Rodney Ellis in attendance Many people of note were there but there were also people who were not among the elected officials people who simply wanted to let the world know that they understand the necessity to commemorate Slavery Remembrance Day By the way it is not unusual for us to have these remembrance days We have a day to remember the day Pearl Harbor was bombed That is a day we set aside annually December 7 We have a day to remember the day that the Twin Towers in New York were attacked when our Nation was attacked and the Twin Towers came tumbling down We have a day set aside to remember the Holocaust the horrors of the Holocaust so that we will never allow it to be repeated any place on the planet Earth There is no event comparable to the Holocaust just as there is no event comparable to slavery the enslavement of people that took place in this country What we want to do now is expand Slavery Remembrance Day We want to make sure that in every church in every house of worship there is an opportunity on August 20 of this year to have a Slavery Remembrance Day ceremony wherein we will explain what happened and proclaim that we must always remember these events that took place Slavery Remembrance Day is important and conscience dictates that we would do such a thing as commemorate the lives that were lost to slavery I will say more about those lives as I move forward with our next Conscience Agenda item which is awarding a Congressional Gold Medal to the enslaved a Congressional Gold Medal to the enslaved I am now using what is called a mnemonic device It is said that if you repeat things multiple times people are more likely to remember than not So in the utilization of this mnemonic device I repeat We want to award a Congressional Gold Medal to the American enslaved There are many people who don t understand and because they don t understand their visceral reaction is Why would you award a Congressional Gold Medal to the enslaved Well I have a Dear Colleague that my dear colleagues will be receiving I am going to read it perhaps not in its entirety but I will cover some of the important excerpts This Dear Colleague reads and this is a part of the style of it the Congressional Gold Medal obviously and it reads Confederate soldiers silence is a way of accentuating Confederate soldiers Confederate soldiers were awarded a Congressional Gold Medal in 1956 The Congress of the United States of America awarded a Congressional Gold Medal to Confederate soldiers in 1956 I figure it can be fairly said that Confederate soldiers were persons who fought on the side of many who were fighting to maintain the institution of slavery We have revered the Confederate soldiers We have reviled those who were enslaved Silence accentuates I go on to indicate I used the personal pronoun I because this is my work but I really am a we person I prefer saying we because nothing is done alone It goes on to read What Congress did for Confederate soldiers it as a matter of conscience should do for the enslaved What we did for Confederate soldiers as a matter of conscience there is a moral imperative to do for the enslaved I am asking Members to support the historic Congressional Gold Medal for America s economic foundational fathers mothers and children the enslaved Note that I said children I am not proud that this happened I love my country but I speak truth to power truth about power I am a liberated Democrat unbought unbossed unafraid and willing to stand here and say I love my country salute the flag say the Pledge of Allegiance sing the national anthem but I am going to tell the truth about our history I want history to also reflect properly that we honored the persons who helped build this country that we would not honor those who sought to enslave them and dishonored those who were enslaved I am asking my colleagues to support the historic Congressional Gold Medal for America s economic foundational fathers mothers and children the enslaved There are already persons who have acknowledged that they will be original cosponsors I call them persons of conscience persons of goodwill persons who understand the zeitgeist of the time I am going to call their names There are 19 such persons By the way if a name is not called it doesn t mean that the name won t be an original cosponsor It just means that these are persons that I have talked to in passing and they have said they would like to be original cosponsors Again I consider them the persons of conscience who have decided to sponsor as original cosponsors this Congressional Gold Medal to the American enslaved Their names are the Honorable Maxine Waters the Honorable Bennie Thompson the Honorable Danny K Davis the Honorable Jim McGovern the Honorable Brad Sherman the Honorable Barbara Lee the Honorable Yvette Clarke the Honorable Hank Johnson the Honorable Gerry Connolly the Honorable Kweisi Mfume the Honorable David Cicilline the Honorable Pete Aguilar the Honorable Ted Lieu the Honorable Adriano Espaillat the Honorable Sylvia Garcia the Honorable Alexandria Ocasio Cortez the Honorable Ilhan Omar the Honorable Ayanna Pressley and the Honorable Troy Carter Only the persons that I have talked to and I might add I have not talked to a single person who has said No we should not honor the enslaved No it is okay to honor the Confederate soldiers but not the enslaved I have not talked to a single person with that mindset Every person without question reservation hesitation or equivocation immediately said Yes Yes sign me up The deadline for original cosponsors for this historic legislation will be February 28 2023 This is the last day of Black History Month Now a little bit more about why this is so important On July 18 1956 the Congress that would be the House and the Senate awarded a Congressional Gold Medal to Confederate soldiers However to this day Congress has never awarded a Congressional Gold Medal to the over 10 million enslaved men women and children who toiled for over 240 years silence accentuates toiled for over 240 years to build the economic and infrastructural foundation of the wealthiest nation to ever exist on the planet Earth These foundational mothers and fathers of our country labored arduously constructing our cities roads bridges and wells They laboriously planted as well as harvested the food that fed our Nation They were the de facto producers of the cash crops that fueled our Nation s foundational wealth These enslaved human beings of African ancestors of African ancestry toiled as slaves without remuneration or recompense Their humble hands were relied upon for the construction of some of our Nation s most renowned edifices and monuments including the White House the Capitol Building and the Washington Monument In truth their sacrificed lives provided the genesis for our Nation s economic preeminence These sacrificed human beings men women and children were the greatest contributors to the American foundational economy Yet their contributions are almost universally forgotten underrecognized ignored overlooked and or undervalued For these and countless other justifications I am beseeching Congress as a matter of conscience silence accentuates I am beseeching Congress as a matter of conscience to award a Congressional Gold Medal collectively to the human beings who are the foundational fathers mothers and children that toiled as slaves without recompense or recognition for their unparalleled contributions to the infrastructural and economic development of the Nation that we enjoy today We are all the beneficiaries of their sacrifice Awarding a Congressional Gold Medal to groups of individuals for those who may not know is not unprecedented as the Congressional Gold Medal was awarded to the Confederate soldiers that I mentioned earlier but also to the Tuskegee Airmen both antemortem and postmortem I might add to the Navajo Code Talkers and postmortem to the servicemembers who perished in Afghanistan on August 26 2021 It is my belief that the men women and children who suffered a great crime against humanity silence accentuates who suffered a great crime against humanity toiling unremunerated as slaves many for their entire work lives are deserving of a Congressional Gold Medal They are deserving to the same extent as those who soldiered to preserve slavery The zeitgeist of our time impels the introduction of this historic legislation and I want Members to know that if they wish to be recognized as a courageous person of conscience who is an original cosponsor that they would please contact my office In the words of Maya Angelou Bringing the gifts my ancestors gave I am the dream and the hope of the slave I would hope that others will join me in bringing forth this historic legislation Now dear friends I call to your attention another piece of legislation It is a resolution that would remove the name of Richard Russell from the Russell Senate Office Building Richard Russell was a self proclaimed white supremacist a self proclaimed white supremacist He helped to author the Southern Manifesto He fought against legislation that would accord punishment for those who were lynched He was a self proclaimed white supremacist His name ought not be on a building that is paid for with tax dollars I am as adamant about this as I would be about a building having the name of someone associated with the Third Reich I would never tolerate that I would take the stand I am taking here and now to get that person s name off of that building No person associated with the Third Reich should have his or her name on a building paid for with taxpayer dollars in a country that professes liberty and justice for all Richard Russell s name needs to be removed and his statue which happens to be in a rotunda devoted to him his statue has to be removed from the building His name off the building his statue removed from the building he is a self proclaimed white supremacist I understand that this is more than some people can handle I understand As a matter of fact it hurts me to even say it If I could live my life and do otherwise I would but my conscience won t allow me to do it My conscience dictates that I must do this This is a part of the conscience agenda His name should be removed Now there are those who would say whose name do you want That is a fair question here is a fair response The fair response is remove his name let it revert to the name that it had prior to his name being placed on the building then select the name of your choice We can remove his name We can separate the removal of his name from the renaming of the building The name that was on the building before it became the Richard Russell Office Building was the Old Senate Office Building Let it revert back to the Old Senate Office Building then select a name I have not pronounced at any point in time that I have a name I have no name to offer I offer justice to people who find that this name is offensive and it is offensive I don t go into the Russell Office Building That is my means of protesting what I see as something that is insulting My guess is that it is insulting to a good many other people A good many don t know the history that I know Perhaps that is the reason they don t take the positions that I take I take this position as a matter of conscience Richard Russell s name should be removed from the Senate office building paid for and maintained with tax dollars The next item on the conscience agenda is the enactment of legislation that we will be filing styled with some variation possibly the Securities and Exchange Atonement Act As the chair of the Subcommittee for Oversight and Investigations of the Financial Services full committee we held hearings We had the largest banks come in and we posed a question Do you think that your institution has done enough to atone for its predecessor institutions or institution having been involved with slavery Let me explain Many of our very large banks I won t go into the names today I am prepared to but I won t many of our largest banking institutions had predecessor institutions meaning banks that at some point they are acquired that literally engaged in the slave trade One bank more than one actually One just came to mind actually took slaves as collateral just as you would take a car a piece of furniture Human beings collateral Then when the person that placed them in the contract as collateral defaulted then they were possessed Just as you would go out and claim a horse that was collateral they took possession of the slaves They made money by trading in slavery and in slaves in this fashion They need to atone There were insurance companies that insured slaves just as you would insure a horse or cattle insured human beings for the benefit of the masters So that if something happened to the human beings the master would be compensated Conscience dictates that there be atonement for this The world has been set in motion such that you cannot create such egregious offenses and just walk away then later say well I had nothing to do with that why should I have to be a part of the atonement process Because we are the beneficiaries of slavery We are The President whom I happen to agree with indicated that great nations don t hide from their history but I would also add great nations do the responsible thing as it relates to their history which is to acknowledge it and then atone for transgressions That is what great nations do This is a great Nation There should be some atonement So we will have this introduced this legislation and colleagues will be given the opportunity to be original cosponsors as well as cosponsors It is not asking too much for us to investigate and find out which of these mega institutions engaged in the utilization of human beings as collateral and insured them as they would cattle We should investigate and they should atone Because of all of these things making it perspicuously clear that we need some sort of reconciliation we will be introducing a resolution legislation in the form of a resolution for a department of reconciliation We have a Department of Labor to deal with labor issues a Department of Commerce to deal with issues associated with commerce and business We have a Department of Defense to deal with issues related to war and peace We ought to have as a matter of conscience a department of reconciliation with a secretary of reconciliation just as we have a Secretary of Labor Secretary of Commerce Secretary of Defense with a budget just as we have a budget for the Secretary of Labor to further the aims of the Department there ought to be a budget for the secretary of reconciliation to further the aims of the department of reconciliation It is time for us to take a systematic approach to dealing with the question of reconciliation in this country A department of reconciliation would have undersecretaries of reconciliation just as we have undersecretaries of commerce and undersecretaries of labor It ought to have a budget that is comparable to its mission I have not set the budget but I do believe that if we index it to the Department of Defense and make it some percentage of that budget we are likely to have it funded on an annual basis So I am of the opinion that we should index it tie it to the budget for the Department of Defense so that we will always have the money necessary These things I would hope would happen in the 118th Congress I don t know that they will to be very candid But I do know this My record will show that as a person of conscience I brought them to the attention of Congress and that Congress had every opportunity to embrace what I believe to be questions of conscience that have to be dealt with at some point This is a methodology a means if you will by which we can address some of the egregious circumstances emanating from the arrival of some 20 odd persons of African ancestry in the English speaking colonies on August 20 1619 That has to be addressed We still have issues that can be logically traced back to the arrival of some 20 odd persons who were of African ancestry on August 20 1619 Let me walk you through a bit of history Yes we ended a war that was a part of bringing slavery to an end and we passed the 13th Amendment The war and the 13th Amendment brought slavery to an end except then there was something called the Black codes These codes allowed persons to be arrested for not having a job If you had been a slave and you are now free they didn t have the kind of systems that we have in place now for persons who are unemployed You would be picked up and arrested Then you could be placed into what is known now and then as a convict leasing program which was simply another way of saying slavery People were placed into this convict leasing program and many of them never left They were placed into this program for petty offenses In Houston just outside of Houston we have a common grave with 95 bodies 95 skeletons the evidence of 95 people who were in a convict leasing program all buried in a common grave So sad It hurts the heart I understand why people don t want to hear it because I don t want to say it Convict leasing is slavery by another name Moving forward in history we then had lawful segregation I lived through lawful segregation I know what it is like to drink colored water I know what it is like to go through a door that had coloreds on it go through the back door to get my food I just celebrated recently last several months on September 1 my 25th birthday for the third time I lived through segregation I know the horrors of it I know what it is like to be separated from others I know what it is like to sit at the back of the bus I know what it is like to understand that you have a separate line when you go into the food store a line for whites and a line for coloreds I know what it is like to be next in line and have every person who happened to be of Anglo ancestry to come ahead of you until every person is served and then you take your opportunity to be served You were last in line simply by being in line It didn t matter whether you got there first I know what it is like I know what it is like to go to schools with hand me down books pages torn out I know what it is like to be bused to schools some 20 miles to another school such that you would not be allowed into the same classroom with children who were of a different hue I know what it is like I suffered it But I am also very proud that we are beyond that I am walking you through this history because there is a point to be made The Civil War ending of segregation ending of convict leasing the one thing that they didn t end was white supremacy The Civil War and the 13th Amendment did not end white supremacy and that is what we have been fighting By the way not all persons who are what we call White who are Anglos are participating intentionally in something that we would call white supremacy That is not the case It is not There is empirical evidence to support the notion that if you are a person of color and have superior credit and seek a loan you are likely to get less money and a higher interest rate than a person who is not of color who doesn t have superior credit The empirical evidence is there Testing has been done By the way there are many people who fight allowing us to do this testing There are people who don t want the empirical evidence to surface They give all kinds of reasons for why we ought not do that We ought to do that because that is a means by which we can ascertain how far we have truly come and understand that sometimes it is the color of skin not the character within that determines the worth of women and men The color of skin still does Try getting a loan as a person of color Personal experience Finished law school and four of us applied for a loan The loan officer cooperated with us We cooperated with him We received a loan to open a business paid every payment on time and paid the loan off early We went back to get another loan A different loan officer declined to let us have a second loan When we judiciously explained we received the first loan we are asking for less money we paid the first loan off we paid it off early and we were never late with a payment his response to us You shouldn t have gotten the first loan I have lived it I don t have to talk about what others have said what they have told me This was a loan officer telling four lawyers who repaid a loan paid on time and repaid the loan early that they shouldn t have gotten that loan One can but only imagine if you are not me what that was like as a lawyer to be told that you didn t qualify for what you qualified for and you repaid The point is this dear brothers and sisters whether you like it or not I consider you my brothers and sisters I do I do because Dr King was right There really is but one race and that is the human race I concur with him when he said that all persons are created equal from a bass black to a treble white I believe he was right when he said that Fleecy locks and black complexion Cannot forfeit nature s claim Skin may differ but affection Dwells in Black and White the same Were I so tall as to reach the pole Or to grasp the ocean at a span I must be measured by my soul The mind is the standard of the man And woman I might add I believe in my country I have faith in the words in the Declaration of Independence persons created equal endowed by the creator with certain unalienable rights among them life liberty and the pursuit of happiness I have faith I have faith in the Pledge of Allegiance liberty and justice for all Don t class me with those people who hate the country I am not a country hater I am a country lover just as I love members of my family that I have to tell the truth about and let them know when they have made mistakes just as you have done similar things with people you love You can love a country and still want to make sure that it lives up to its promise This is about living up to the promise the Conscience Agenda Remember now those who do this I know that some to quote Dr King will ask and respond to cowardice which asks the question Is it safe Cowardice asks the question is it safe Expediency asks the question is it politic Vanity asks the question is it popular But conscience asks the question is it right I believe this is not only the right thing to do but the Conscience Agenda is the righteous thing to do Because I believe it I shall pursue it I believe that there are persons in this Congress who will join us in the Conscience Agenda who will understand that there may be times when you have to do that which is neither safe nor politic nor popular To quote Dr King you do it because conscience says it is right Mr. Speaker I yield back the balance of my time
555	Mr. Speaker first of all I would like to start out with some housekeeping A lot has been said over the last few days about the huge number of IRS employees that are intended to be added by the Biden administration and I just want to clarify some numbers There are new employees who are going to replace retired employees but there are still 25 000 new employees who are going to be added to the Internal Revenue Service I should point out that over time you would expect and this apparently surprises some people you would expect the number of IRS employees to drop I used to do taxes I haven t done those for over 25 years now Even at that time as things became more computerized if you got interest income or dividend income or capital gain income the IRS would match up those numbers with what appeared on your tax return If you got from U S Bank 1 000 and you didn t put it on your return you could expect a letter in the mail Where is the 1 000 Please give us another 300 in taxes You do not need more employees to do that sort of thing Again when you talk about 25 000 more employees than the past for a State the size of Wisconsin that is really a small army of 500 new employees Sometimes it is easier to bring down to the State level because we deal with such big numbers Whether you are talking about Massachusetts Maryland Missouri or Washington State they all can expect about 500 new employees While there may be some people cheating an increase of that size is just inappropriate Immigration
556	Let s look one more time at the new numbers that were released over Christmas break as far as the immigration situation in this country We have a new all time record for the number of people coming here in November over 200 000 210 000 people These numbers were released by the way late on a Friday Friday as always so the mainstream press which already does a bad job of covering this issue does not bring them up A lot of the focus has been on title 42 While that didn t go into effect it didn t stop there from becoming an all time high When I talk about 210 000 in November 2022 a year before that we were at 131 000 for November The year before that before President Biden took office we were around 20 000 We have gone from 20 000 to 210 000 I am somebody who believes in intact families Just as scary is the callousness of the Biden administration to the degree to which the open border situation tears apart families In November there were over 9 000 unaccompanied minors released to sponsors apart from their parents A year ago instead of 9 000 people being broken away from their parents we had about 10 000 again the Biden administration A year before that the final year of another administration was 1 200 There were months in which we had under 200 unaccompanied minors enter the country We are now over 9 000 Please I wish we remembered that when we have our open borders policy we are causing so many children to be raised apart from their parents I also want to point out the number of got aways which is a particularly dangerous subgroup of people coming here illegally So that you folks understand there are two big groups of people coming here illegally There are people who ask for asylum They don t deserve it but they ask for asylum and turn themselves in to the Border Patrol At least we get to do a little medical checkup on them We are allowed to get a little bit of information on them If we have the right name which we may or may not we can do a little bit of criminal background check on whether they have committed crimes in the United States or Canada There is another group of people called got aways that race across the border and take advantage of the fact that right now so many Border Patrol agents are just doing paperwork We have as far as I can see the all time high 73 000 got aways in November 2022 So that you understand if you are somebody who is sneaking fentanyl across the border if you are somebody who has a criminal record how would you come here Would you turn yourself in to the Border Patrol Not likely You would rather sneak across the border The fact that that subset is increasing even greater than the people who turn themselves in to the Border Patrol should scare every American to death It is time for President Biden to do a little bit more than a perfunctory stop at the border He has to look at 2 years ago in November 2020 when that 210 000 figure was under 20 000 It can be done once it can be done again The American people and the press corps in America ought to hold him accountable and ask him to explain why we used to as a matter of fact earlier in 2020 we were under 10 000 people a month why we used to be able to hold these numbers under 10 000 a month and now we are over 200 000 and why we used to be able to keep the unaccompanied minors under 1 000 and now they are over 9 000 When I talk about unaccompanied minors I am not including minors that were rented by other people because they felt it would be easier to get here with a family The Border Patrol knows that is happening as well Maybe you rent little Johnny to somebody who says we want to be a family That is another thing that is not even showing in these numbers We don t know how often it happens We just know that it happens I realize that Black Lives Matter has been hostile to the traditional nuclear family I realize that is an important group for a lot of Members on the other side of the aisle but I will tell you I don t like it at all when I see over 9 000 unaccompanied minors coming into this country I want to point out another number that doesn t appear on here and I wish we would keep track of it and that is the degree to which we separate the family Maybe one parent comes here with the kids but not two parents In America our family court system if people get divorced we try to keep both parents around the area for the children It breaks the heart of Border Patrol that they see no effort being done at the border In other words if one parent shows up with the kids maybe dad maybe mom is left home in Guatemala El Salvador or wherever we don t care It really bothers the Border Patrol because of course when it comes to American children we love them enough that we try to keep both parents involved But when it comes to the policy at the border we don t care I am also told by the way that this policy bothers governments of the countries that these people came from because they themselves have family courts and they would like to keep both parents involved in their children s lives They don t like the callousness of the United States how they don t care whether the family is apart or not There is another side to this story as far as what is going on on the southern border as well and that is the number of deportations You know people say Oh we all have such wonderful people crossing the border blah blah blah Well they are all not that wonderful They are people that commit crimes people that we catch doing wrong things And while our immigration system is relatively weak our deportation is weak compared to what it should be at least some people historically have been turned back south of the border If you look that number was usually over 200 000 under President Trump 250 000 260 000 It slipped to 185 000 in President Trump s final year in part because of the COVID We recently got the numbers for fiscal year 2022 where it is 72 000 The COVID crisis is not exclusively but largely over so here we are in a situation in which we have under a third of the number of deportations which we used to have So not only are we letting everybody come here and not only are we encouraging the breakdown of the families by having so many unaccompanied minors coming here we are not deporting people like we have in the past I have talked to a Federal attorney and it disappointed him because he knows the rules they could have operated under in which you are able to now commit more crimes do more bad things and apparently the U S Government doesn t care Of course eventually as we let more people commit crimes in this country there is going to be an increase in the crime rate It is going to be a less civil America I wish and I beg the Biden administration to find some of the officials left over from the past administration and have them show them how it is done so we don t continue to have so many people who have criminal records wind up in the United States Now speaking of things that have happened since the new year we finally have the murders in Milwaukee the city which I was born in I love Milwaukee so much When I was a child Milwaukee had the lowest murder rate of the 25 biggest cities in the country depending on the year it was either them or San Diego This year we exploded to a new record We went up from 197 to 224 in 1 year That is 27 more than the previous all time high I can remember when Milwaukee had a much smaller population but that number was under 40 Well what happened Part of it of course is the police hatred that goes on in our society I think that really began around Ferguson Missouri where it was called the Ferguson effect and police began to become afraid to enforce the law No matter how much they were in the right and of course the Justice Department did investigations in Ferguson and they found out the policeman was in the right in that tragic death they still were attacked by opportunistic politicians and opportunistic clergy We had a situation in Ferguson they called the policemen racists The Justice Department even under Barack Obama felt nothing had been done wrong The opportunistic and offensive Al Sharpton showed up and attacked or verbally attacked the police in that area rather than becoming persona non grata Rather than being pushed aside we see politicians still trying to ingratiate themselves to Al Sharpton and still trying to promote his divisive world view So it is not surprising as the police back off despite the population falling the number of murders continue to go up I beg the Members of this body to reject the Al Sharpton divisiveness Stop standing up on the dais with him Stop attending joint meetings with him and promoting that lying clergyman It is an embarrassment to Christianity It is an embarrassment to America I can t believe there are Members of this body who think he is somebody to promote his view to the world Then we have what I think is the root cause We have a continued break down of the family in America We know that Black Lives Matter that played such a big role in the 2020 elections hates the nuclear family But I wish our social scientists would do a little more investigation on the role of the break down of the family and the anger particularly of the young men the fact that so many men don t have a family to take care of because the government takes care of all the families And we work our way back to what the murder rate was in the 1960s before you had the huge war on the family initiated by Lyndon Johnson I ask the social scientists and I ask the journalists to demand information on the background of the murderers that are caught not enough are caught who are committing the murders in Milwaukee and also the family backgrounds of those unfortunate souls who have died because of the Ferguson effect and the police hatred that is fomented by Members of this body My final comment here is with regard to another year gone another year we will wind up we will get the numbers shortly with over 100 000 people dying of illegal drug overdoses We all know two things that politicians should do immediately because almost all these drugs come across the border we should shut down that border and prevent any more Americans from dying Big numbers are kind of easy to gloss over and it is important to remember when we are talking about 107 000 or 108 000 I am old enough to remember the Vietnam war we are having twice as many people die of illegal drug overdoses in this country than has died in the Vietnam war The Vietnam war went on for 12 years there were protests there was so much commentary on the number of people who died and they were all heroes and we should talk about it But we have twice as many people dying in 1 year in this country as died in 12 years in Vietnam Do you think any increased effort is made to close the border No Politicians don t care about that 108 000 Remember they all had parents some had children some had siblings some had friends but we are so callous we don t care another 107 000 What difference does it make The other thing you should do because it is up to the police to find these drug dealers we one more time should have a little more respect for the police I will shortly be introducing a bill to allow the Border Patrol to hire more drug sniffing dogs Anybody who takes the tour down there I am sure Joe Biden didn t hang around long enough to find this out would find out how tremendous those dogs are They are not cheap When I think of all the people who died because of the drug overdoses I really hope in the upcoming budget we maybe find more money by getting rid of all the new lawyers we are hiring to represent the people coming here illegally Instead of hiring more lawyers we hire more drug sniffing dogs Maybe we can reduce the numbers of Americans who are dying of drug overdoses as people come across the border So those are a few things for the American people to digest some more things the mainstream media ought to be taking up A little more headlines even if the administration releases the immigration numbers on a Friday publicize you know the huge numbers of people who are coming across the border Do not get anesthetized and stop caring about the huge numbers of ever increasing Americans who are dying of illegal drug overdoses Please take action Mr. Speaker I yield back the balance of my time

574	Mr Speaker today I introduce the Securities and Exchange Commission Real Estate Leasing Authority Revocation Act which would revoke the real estate leasing authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and direct the Government Accountability Office to update its 2016 report on independent leasing authority in the federal government The House passed this bill last Congress Since the SEC was granted leasing authority in 1990 before I came to Congress the SEC has consistently stumbled through leasing mistakes at great expense to taxpayers It is time for Congress to end this fiasco and return the leasing authority to the General Services Administration GSA the federal government s real estate arm like other federal agencies When Congress exempted the SEC from GSA regulations and directives in 1990 it expressed its clear intent that the authority granted to the Commission to lease its own office space directly will be exercised vigorously by the Commission to achieve actual cost savings and to increase the Commission s productivity and efficiency H R Conf Rep 101 924 Over the past 30 years none of that has come to fruition The SEC did not even establish a Leasing Branch until April 2009 and did not put into place any leasing policies or procedures until August 2010 Before that in May 2005 the SEC disclosed that it had identified unbudgeted costs of approximately 48 million attributable to misestimates and omissions of costs associated with the construction of its headquarters near Union Station In 2007 after moving into its headquarters the SEC shuffled its employees to different office spaces at a cost of over 3 million without any cost benefit analysis or justifiable rationale In the summer of 2010 the SEC s Office of Administrative Services OAS conducted a deeply flawed and unsound analysis to justify the need for the SEC to lease 900 000 square feet of space at Constitution Center and to commit over 500 million over 10 years overestimating the amount of space needed by over 300 percent In addition to this gross overestimation of space OAS failed to provide complete and accurate information and prepared a faulty and backdated Justification and Approval after it had already signed the lease As a former chair and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Economic Development Public Buildings and Emergency Management I was deeply involved in oversight of the SEC s real estate activities in the District of Columbia after the agency engaged in this improper sole source procurement of nearly one million square feet of leased space We held two hearings on this subject in 2011 At the first hearing titled The Security and Exchange Commission s 500 Million Fleecing of America SEC Inspector General H David Kotz testified that employees ignored the SEC chair s explicit instructions and engaged in possible criminal violations in a sole source procurement He also supported stripping the SEC of leasing authority if the SEC did not undertake major reforms I agreed with Inspector General Katz s evaluation and introduced legislation to revoke the SEC s leasing authority for the first time At the second hearing titled The Security and Exchange Commission s 500 Million Fleecing of America Part Two SEC Chairwoman Mary L Schapiro testified that the SEC recognizes the benefits of having GSA manage the Commission s future lease acquisitions Leasing is not part of the Commission s core mission and we cannot allow it to impede that mission She then explained that the SEC would pare down its leasing program solely to liaise with GSA This arrangement in which GSA manages SEC leasing activities was memorialized in a Memorandum of Understanding between GSA and the SEC on August 1 2011 Today I have concerns that the SEC is going back on the commitment it made to Congress which is why I am reintroducing this bill In August 2016 GSA and the SEC entered into an Occupancy Agreement to authorize GSA to conduct the process for a new 15 year lease In December 2016 GSA with the approval of the SEC submitted a prospectus to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure for approximately 1 274 000 rentable square feet for the SEC Congress approved this prospectus in 2018 and by July 2019 GSA had received final bids resolved all protests and even selected a final bidder A month later in August 2019 the SEC canceled the Occupancy Agreement with GSA citing concerns about the value of the purchase option that was part of the lease concerns the SEC refused to document to Congress The SEC effectively vetoed the entire procurement process despite not having the authority or funding mechanism to exercise the purchase option without GSA s involvement After a few more months of impasse the SEC requested that GSA cancel the procurement and commence a new procurement process Finally after much back and forth between the two agencies GSA entered into a lease for a new SEC headquarters in September 2021 The SEC says it will continue to have GSA do its leasing in the future but the SEC s history of egregious leasing conduct having squandered hundreds of millions of dollars makes this bill still necessary These public blunders also risk undermining the reputation of GSA and the federal government among developers and building owners that participate in these lease procurements and ultimately driving up the costs of all GSA real estate procurements due to the threat of uncertainty This also means that the SEC will continue to engage in short term leases at a premium while the procurement process plays out again instead of quickly transitioning to a more cost effective long term lease as planned Congress created this confusion by granting the SEC leasing authority and now Congress must fix it by revoking that authority The SEC s mission is to protect investors maintain fair orderly and efficient markets and facilitate capital formation GSA s mission is to provide other civilian federal agencies with workspace and furnishings at best value to the taxpayer As the SEC has demonstrated over three decades it is incredibly inefficient wasteful and redundant to have the SEC involved in the nuances of real estate decisions when GSA exists for that very reason Like other federal agencies the SEC would continue to have input and involvement in the decision making process but the ultimate real estate authority would lie with GSA where it belongs I urge my colleagues to support this bill

594	Mr. Speaker today the thoughts of the Senate are with the people of Monterey Park CA as they heal from this weekend s tragic and terrible shooting What should have been a weekend of joy and celebration within the AAPI community as they celebrate the Lunar New Year turned into another occasion of grief and mourning I spoke yesterday with the sheriff of Los Angeles County and assured him that the Federal Government is ready to provide whatever assistance they need right now While first responders are still investigating the causes of this incident it is clear that the prevalence of guns in our country have made tragedies like this one too frequent While the Senate passed bipartisan gun safety legislation last year and that was a very welcome move more should be done My thoughts are with all the families and the loved ones of the victims of this insidious attack I thank all the first responders and even the private citizens who responded quickly to stop the shooter and prevent even more lives from tragically being cut short 118th Congress Mr. Speaker I want to also welcome our new colleague from Nebraska and wish him the best Now this week for the first time in the 118th Congress both Chambers gavel into session to begin anew the work of serving the American people It is a new era here in Congress an era of divided government where both parties will have to demonstrate they can work together to solve our Nation s problems Democrats begin the 118th Congress with an open hand of cooperation and I urge my Republican colleagues to respond in kind so we can hit the ground running We have a lot of difficult and important work ahead of us perhaps none more important than working together to raise the debt ceiling and protecting the full faith and credit of the United States In America when it is time to pay the bills we have followed through on our obligations without any exception In the months to come I expect we are going to hear a lot from our Republican colleagues about the debt ceiling So let me begin by making a few things perfectly clear at the onset First few issues require more bipartisanship cooperation and serious mindedness than making sure that America is able to pay its debts on time At stake is the health of our economy and the very stability of the global financial system Should the U S default on its debt the consequences could be severe and it is going to affect just about every average American family This is not some esoteric issue that is just abstract and way up there in the clouds It is going to affect all of us Listen to what could happen if we default Interest rates will go up on mortgages on car loans on credit cards pensions the money people have put aside will lose billions so will IRAs and 401Ks in all likelihood Home values will decline because when mortgage interest rates go up people are willing to pay less for homes That is a lot of money for lots of people For many people their home is their rock It is all they have By playing brinksmanship some of the MAGA Republicans on the other side of the aisle on the other side in the House are risking just that So again this is not an abstract issue Real Americans will see real dollars from so much of what they own disappear from their pensions their IRAs their home value Merely approaching a default could raise costs on everything from mortgages and car loans to credit card interest rates So it is going to hurt average families This is not an abstract argument And as the months go on and as we get closer and closer to the day that we have to act the American people will see this and we are going to make sure of that Second raising the debt ceiling has consistently been a bipartisan responsibility for decades Neither party has played brinksmanship Since 1960 the debt ceiling has been raised approximately 80 times under both Republican and Democratic administrations under both unified and divided government I will note once again that while President Trump was in office and Republicans had the House and Senate Democrats voted to raise the debt ceiling We did it not once not twice but three times including twice under Republican majorities in the House and Senate Of course we could have done what some MAGA Republicans want threatening to block debt ceiling extensions unless we got our way But we knew how badly it would hurt the American people and we didn t do it This time should be no different Brinksmanship hostage taking default on the debt should be off the table Both parties should work together to ensure we can continue to pay our debt on time and we Democrats are ready to move quickly in order to make that happen Indeed we are ready to move well in advance of default because even brinksmanship over the debt ceiling can cause serious damage to the economy and to individual American families Unfortunately Mr. Speaker unfortunately House Republicans have kicked off their new majority by saying yes to brinksmanship yes to hostage taking and yes even to risking default all because of draconian spending cuts pushed by the hard right House Republicans approach to the debt ceiling is dangerous destabilizing and the only thing it accomplishes is making a bipartisan solution less likely If Republicans want to show that they can govern effectively they are off to a pretty poor start If House Republicans are serious about taking the debt limit hostage in exchange for spending cuts the new rules that they adopted require them to bring a proposal to the floor of the House and show the American people precisely what kind of cuts they want to make It is not enough to hide behind the old GOP talking points about wasteful spending When you are in the majority substance counts If Republicans are talking about draconian cuts they have an obligation to show Americans what those cuts are and let the public react And let s let them do it now not 6 months from now when the danger of default is much closer House Republicans You voted for rules that require regular order for bringing bills to the floor So put your proposals for debt ceiling on the floor let the entirety of the House debate it and vote on it and let the American people see and assess these cuts for themselves Otherwise Americans are going to be left with some pretty big questions Republicans say they want spending cuts Well does that mean cuts to Social Security or Medicare or childcare or Pell grants or our military or pay raises for our troops or funding police and law enforcement Many House Republicans are serious about cutting national defense in exchange for raising the debt ceiling I hope they are not but many seem to be or maybe they are pushing cuts to public health and nurses and hospitals Whatever the case may be Americans deserve to know what kind of cuts Republicans want to make and why they think it is worth forcing an unnecessary crisis that will hurt most American families Frankly I expect the House Republicans themselves will struggle to come up with a serious answer because deep down they know that no matter what they propose their cuts are likely to be deeply unpopular with the American people This is the central quandary of the new majority By yielding so much to the whims of the MAGA hard right House Republicans have boxed themselves in and now have to choose between serving the American people or pleasing the extremists within their ranks We are already seeing this play out when it comes to the debt ceiling I yield the floor

596	Moments ago the Senate returned to our full 100 person strength as Nebraska s new junior Senator took the oath of office The Cornhusker State expects a lot from its leaders For the last 8 years Nebraskans could rest easy knowing they had Deb Fischer and Ben Sasse on the job here in Washington And during that same time of course they also had an outstanding leader even closer to home As Governor Pete Ricketts applied private sector savvy to the work of public administration with great effect He secured for Nebraska families and small businesses the biggest tax relief in that State s history He championed parents rights and defended civics education In the face of a global pandemic he built the State s response on common sense saving lives but also safeguarding livelihoods preserving liberties and protecting kids educations all at the same time The people of Nebraska chose wisely in electing and re electing Governor Ricketts by huge margins And their new Governor chose wisely in sending his predecessor here to this Chamber I know I speak for the entire Senate in extending a warm welcome to Senator Ricketts and his wife Susanne Pete we are glad to have you here on the team 118th Congress Mr. Speaker on another matter the American people want and need this 118th Congress to work differently than the past 2 years that were just finished We just had 2 years of one party Democratic control 2 years of spending us into record inflation on party line votes 2 years of ignoring top priorities of the American people like violent crime and open borders two years of Senate Democrats procrastinating on basic government duties in order to push radical proposals like an unprecedented elections takeover and unlimited abortion on demand for all 9 months The American people put an end to that one party government because they wanted change This year the Senate leadership must not put off our most basic jobs like intelligently funding our Federal Government and providing for our Armed Forces before the very last minute Basic duties like the appropriations process and the National Defense Authorization Act need more thoughtfulness more bipartisanship and more regular order And they must not be shoved into late December after the Senate Democrats waste literally months looking for ways to placate the radical left The American people elected a bipartisan divided government The country voted to change Washington So this Chamber s Democratic leadership needs to change accordingly
597	Mr. Speaker I want to begin by welcoming our newest Senator from the State of Nebraska Pete Ricketts I don t know him well but I am sure I will come to know him I certainly know his family They have made their impression on the city of Chicago by purchasing the historic franchise the Chicago Cubs They have made major investments in the city of Chicago and the State of Illinois in that pursuit Best of all they have virtually guaranteed that Wrigley Field is going to stay in Wrigley Field exactly where it should be It is one of the cathedrals of baseball in America and the Ricketts family has made a commitment to it which is certainly satisfying to devout baseball fans like myself I hope the time of the new Senator will be productive and gratifying Work in this body can sometimes be slow and frustrating but with patience good things can happen
598	Mr. Speaker it is great to be back with my Senate colleagues this week It has been a while But we need to get a lot done in this year s new Congress As a new Congress is getting underway our country faces many problems many problems that we need to address However as we look ahead to what we can accomplish this Congress we also need to look back and learn from the past Having the courage to recognize and address problems prevents us from making problems and continuing the same thing in the future It is high time we take a look back at the devastating impacts of some of the Federal and State government policies in response to COVID 19 and the pandemic Most importantly we have to focus on education We have to look at the toll the lockdowns have taken on our country s youngest citizens Unfortunately like many issues in DC the COVID crisis was weaponized for some political gain The government misused emergency measures to grow its control over Americans daily lives Hopefully those days are over This time 3 years ago COVID was making its way around our country through the States and through the communities Of course in the early days we knew very little about the virus and how to respond to it so leaders in both parties leaders across our States and our communities called for a pause in daily activities to get control of the spread of COVID 19 But what we didn t know then was how long that pause would last not just in some areas but all over our country And we certainly didn t know that our response could end up being worse the response that we had being worse than the actual COVID that was running across our country We are just now starting to understand the impact of COVID related lockdowns They weren t just extreme they were deadly in some areas Research led by a professor at the University of Chicago exposed the deadly impact of lockdowns by analyzing the excess death rate in our country during the use of these lockdowns The excess rate is a term used to describe the number of deaths above historical norms or how many more Americans died than we would typically expect to pass away during any given year So those were balanced up and looked at from the years of COVID to the years past According to the data from the CDC the number of non COVID excess deaths reached almost 100 000 people in 2020 and in 2021 The hundreds of thousands of non COVID excess deaths during the pandemic can be mainly attributed to shocking increases in accidents overdoses and death from alcoholism and homicide Those causes disproportionately impacted minorities and low income Americans the same groups lockdowns were often billed and made to protect The number of deaths from hypertension and heart disease and diabetes also skyrocketed during the pandemic This was especially true for America s young people In total excess deaths among young adults throughout the pandemic were 27 percent higher than they should be according to historical records of years past It does not take a scientist to draw the connection between lockdowns and all the excess deaths that we have had the last 3 years Not only were Americans kept out of gyms parks churches social settings and family gatherings they were forced to skip routine doctor visits surgeries and in person medical treatments out of fear And fear was the main weapon used against the American people As a result mental and physical health plummeted While lockdowns across the country slowly ended the deadly repercussions did not For example through the middle of last year overdose deaths per year outnumbered the total number of military deaths in the past 60 years The truth is the physical and mental health consequences of overreaching lockdowns will be measured for years and years to come Locking Americans out of school work church and social contact had disastrous impacts on our economy our education system and our society as a whole We all saw businesses across the country go under as customers were kept away and the daily hum of our economy was silenced As kids were forced into virtual schooling an entire generation of Americans lost months and even years of valuable educational opportunities Research conducted by the global consulting firm McKinsey found that COVID related school disruption left students 5 months behind in math and 4 months behind in reading Students who were already underserved were hit even harder by school closures High schoolers were left more likely to drop out and less likely to pursue further education after the lockdowns And more than 35 percent of American parents were left very or extremely concerned about their children s mental health Today our schools are facing a shortage of teachers months of instruction still missing and a mental health and behavioral crisis among our country s students It is a pandemic As someone who spent decades myself as an educator and a coach who fostered the potential of young adults I am committed to ensuring we never inflict the damage on our school age kids again no matter what I bring up these sobering facts on health and education to call on this body to join me in this commitment in this Congress to do away with what we just did We have to evaluate it We cannot keep going forward this way This is especially important as some influential people in our government media and public health circles continue today to call for measures that disrupt our society in ways we know have terrible consequences The Biden administration is hellbent on keeping the COVID 19 public health emergency that is still in place We still have it today Just last week President Biden extended the emergency declaration because of the extra power it gives to the Federal Government and he does that for another 90 days Attorneys for the Federal Government were in court asking an unelected judge to reinstate the national mask mandate for air travel just in the last few weeks Keep in mind this body in a bipartisan manner voted to end the emergency declaration just this last year something we should do again in this Congress But even though the President himself has deemed the pandemic over bureaucrats are obsessed with keeping this charade going Enough is enough We must be the barrier between the American people and tyranny because tyrannical orders like the COVID lockdowns are dangerous to every citizen in this country As we get to work this Congress I hope all my colleagues will join me in recognizing the tough realities I have just laid out We cannot continue to do this and we can t do it again We have to commit to defending freedom in every circumstance We have to learn from our past mistakes I suggest the absence of a quorum
599	Mr. Speaker after a busy and productive time at home for several weeks I am glad to be back in the Senate as we kick off the new year and a new Congress After 2 years of Democrats controlling both Chambers the House and Senate the American people voted for a change in the midterm election Voters sent a Republican majority to the House and opted for a divided government With a Republican House Democrats of course will no longer be able to abuse the budget reconciliation process to circumvent the normal legislative process which means the end to partisan spending bills They will have no choice but to work for common ground and to move legislation through what we call regular order around here which means by the rules While there is a lot we need to do in the coming months one of our top priorities must be the humanitarian and security crisis at the southern border This crisis has been raging since President Biden took office 2 years ago Day after day month after month migrants have crossed the border in unprecedented numbers Over the years we have seen migration surges at different times but nothing like this The scale and the immensity of this crisis are unprecedented Last month U S Customs and Border Protection encountered more than 250 000 migrants at the southern border That is the back door to my State the State of Texas A quarter of a million people in a single month that is a new record and a shocking number To put that in perspective Customs and Border Protection encountered more migrants in November and December last year than it did in all of 2017 more in 2 months the last 2 months of last year than it did in the entire year of 2017 Those figures tell you a lot but no words can accurately capture just how complex and challenging the situation at the border truly is To understand what is happening on the ground you need to show up You need to see it firsthand and you need to listen and learn from the experts and the people who are dealing with this day in and day out I have traveled to the border many many times over the last few years as this crisis has gotten worse I have spoken with the law enforcement officials who have taken an oath to uphold and enforce our laws the nonprofits groups like Catholic Charities which provide humanitarian services local officials mayors and county judges who are responsible to their own taxpayers for providing services that are overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of people coming across the border Then there are private landowners who find that their fences are knocked down their properties are trashed and that people trespass upon it at will Then there are the small business owners that depend on the foot traffic that frequently comes back and forth across the border and countless others who are impacted by the current border crisis Of course these are exactly the kinds of people you might want to talk to if you actually had an interest in learning more about what the problem is and fashioning some kind of solution I was happy to introduce these experts to a bipartisan group of my Senate colleagues a couple of weeks ago Both of us representing border States Senator Sinema the Senator from Arizona and I have had what you might call an exchange program between our two States A couple of years ago I visited Tucson AZ and Senator Sinema in turn visited the Rio Grande Valley for a series of briefings The first thing that jumps out at you is that the border is big 2000 miles It covers a lot of territory and it varies a lot depending on whether you visit urban areas like El Paso or rural areas like Yuma AZ That is why while I am happy that President Biden finally went to the border in El Paso briefly I know he could not have gotten a full awareness of the challenges that the current crisis as a result of his open border policies presents Nevertheless seeing two very different border crossings was valuable to both Senator Sinema and myself and we decided it was time to share that information with our colleagues So we invited several of them to join us In total there were eight of us eight Senators on the trip On the Republican side we had Senators Tillis Lankford Moran and myself On the Democratic side we had Senators Kelly Murphy and Coons Actually now that Senator Sinema has declared herself as an Independent she said that this was not a bipartisan trip but a tripartisan trip We spent a day in El Paso speaking with law enforcement and local stakeholders In recent months the city of El Paso has been ground zero and overwhelmed by the influx of migrants It doesn t have the capacity no border community does to care for the tens of thousands of people coming across the border daily or the infrastructure to house them or to transport them safely to other locations Fortunately at least in the near term and it tends to go in waves up and down most recently the pace in El Paso has slowed down but some of the sidewalks downtown are still lined with makeshift tents and sleeping bags migrants camping out in the city nowhere to go waiting for their next meal and waiting for some place warm to be able to sleep We heard about the tremendous burden this crisis has placed on law enforcement at all levels You can imagine it They are already understaffed and now they are overwhelmed We heard about the growing strain on the nongovernmental organizations and the cities as they try to mitigate this crisis Again this is a crisis of the President s own making as a result of his open border policies and the failure to enforce our immigration laws We heard from business leaders who depend on customers coming to their business as well as other local stakeholders about the larger impact this crisis has had on the El Paso community and the southwest border region especially the effect it has had on legitimate trade and travel which are vital to the region s economy I don t know if most nonborder State Senators understand it or not but we have the largest land port in America in Laredo TX They have somewhere between 14 to 16 000 trucks a day come across the border for legitimate trade and commerce Obviously that legitimate trade and commerce that creates a lot of jobs all across America are impeded by this vast influx of humanity that are coming currently as a result of the nonenforcement policies of the administration The day after we visited El Paso we traveled to Yuma AZ And if you are looking at a map of Arizona it is in the southwest portion of Arizona just right next to California at the very southern southwest tip of Arizona Yuma AZ is an agricultural community by and large a small town not a lot of infrastructure not a lot of hospitals schools or other places for migrants to be taken care of when they come to the border So it is no surprise that the Border Patrol there in Yuma AZ a little small town on the southwestern border of Arizona the Border Patrol agents are strained security missions are taking a hit and it has become even more challenging to process and care for the volume of migrants they see coming across the border Now lest anybody think that illegal immigration is just related to Mexico and Central America people fleeing poverty and violence the acting Border Patrol chief in the Yuma sector told us that in that sector alone they encountered migrants speaking 200 languages from 176 countries this little sleepy town in southwest Arizona people speaking 200 languages from 176 countries Well you might ask How is that possible Where are these people coming from I thought they were all coming from Mexico or maybe even Central America Well it just so happens that there is a major city just south of Yuma AZ in northern Mexico called Mexicali and what we are seeing is international human smuggling operations flying people into Mexicali and then turning up in Yuma and claiming asylum again overwhelming the capacity of this small little border town to be able to deal with these huge numbers and people frankly abusing the asylum system which is supposed to be people fleeing from persecution There are people with Gucci luggage coming across the border and claiming asylum knowing that because of the broken asylum process they will be transported into the interior of the United States and given a notice to appear for a future court hearing But because of the backlog of the immigration courts it will be literally years before they are notified to show up If they do show up 90 percent of them will be unsuccessful in obtaining asylum But the fact is they don t which should be a surprise to no one Well as I said I have learned a lot from the experts on the ground and I hope our colleagues our bipartisan delegation of Senators did as well I appreciate the Senators who took the time to visit El Paso and Yuma and I know all of us appreciate the men and women on the frontlines who took time out of their busy schedules already overwhelmed by this humanitarian crisis and border security crisis They took the time to talk to us hoping just hoping that we might be able to do something to help them Now eight Senators it won t surprise you have different views and ideas about how to solve the crisis Standing together along the border doesn t mean we agree on everything but it does mean that we are interested in finding solutions There are conversations occurring in the House and the Senate and Members from both sides of the aisle are floating a range of ideas to address the crisis There are some bipartisan conversations occurring including Senator Sinema from Arizona and Senator Tillis from North Carolina and I am glad they are working on this and I am eager to see what they come up with As we all know President Biden has shown that he is completely unwilling to use his current authorities to secure the border And the truth is he has plenty of authorities but refuses to do his duty and enforce our laws So it is time for Congress to take action Of course that is something that is easier said than done 535 of us 435 in the House and 100 in the Senate It is not easy to get everybody or at least a majority on the same page and we have the new reality of divided government as I said earlier But we do have within our capacity the ability to try and to achieve consensus and the art of the possible I know it is going to be a huge reach a steep hill pick your metaphor It is going to be hard because the Democratic majority in the Senate has a very different approach than a Republican majority in the House But we have to be realistic about what can pass the House and earn 60 votes in the Senate A bill that will pass only one Chamber won t accomplish anything in dealing with this crisis Of course at this moment the border crisis is consuming all the oxygen in the room but this must be addressed before we will be able to come to an agreement on any other immigration reforms It is a prerequisite a foundation for any larger agreement The million dollar question is What will that look like As my colleagues and I saw a couple of weeks ago one of the biggest challenges is processing and holding capacity This is a feature of the current catch and release policies of the Biden administration It is not a bug It is a feature of their catch and release policies and it is being exploited daily by the criminal organizations that continue to get rich smuggling people and drugs across the border Our system simply was not designed to keep up with the influx of this many people crossing the border every day As a result Border Patrol agents told us that they are being shifted from the frontlines to process people in the back office leaving huge security gaps fully 40 percent in some instances of the border left unprotected because the Border Patrol has to process the migrants and they have to leave the frontlines to do so which means that the drug smugglers have an opening which they exploit on a regular basis to move illegal drugs into the United States Cartels are using these corridors to traffic fentanyl and other dangerous drugs into the country the drugs that took the lives of 108 000 Americans last year alone One hundred eight thousand Americans died due to drug overdoses from drugs almost entirely coming across the southwestern border You wonder what it will take to get people s attention to wake up to this public health hazard this public safety hazard this humanitarian and national security crisis At the same time migrants with weak and even frivolous asylum claims are being released into the country to await a court date that is years down the line As I said many are no shows having successfully made it into the United States without any legal right to immigrate That has got to change We also need to strengthen border security which I would define again based on learning from Border Patrol and other experts along the border border security requires a combination of personnel technology and infrastructure That includes appropriately located barriers fences levees It includes sensors cameras roadways and more agents to prevent dangerous people and dangerous substances from entering our country A safe and secure border relies on all of these elements It is clear that Congress needs to invest in more resources but more than that in correct policies so that immigration across our border will be safe orderly humane and legal This movement of masses of humanity 250 000 a month handled by the human smugglers and by the cartels who are getting rich this is not good for anybody It is not good for the migrants who are viewed as a mere commodity many of whom are left to die Many young girls and women are sexually assaulted en route because these cartels don t view them as human beings they view them as a commodity something they can trade for money Well there are a range of other reforms that I am looking at as we try to find our way toward a solution I am open to hearing from anyone who has an idea and I hope we can have a serious debate and solutions here in Congress What the President saw in El Paso was a snapshot of a sanitized border I have no illusions that he has any depth of understanding about the complexity of what we are dealing with there but I am glad he finally showed up after 2 years Given a Republican majority in the House and a Democratic majority in the Senate we need to be realistic about what it is we might be able to accomplish But again this is all about what somebody has called the art of the possible That is what legislating is all about But the fact is there is an unprecedented humanitarian and security crisis at the southern border and it is past time for Congress to do something to address it I yield the floor
600	Mr. Speaker it was so wonderful to have time this month to kick off my annual 95 county tour which is what I do in Tennessee each year And I know that my colleagues across the aisle think they are here starting fresh with a new Congress but that is not the way the people in Tennessee see this As I have talked with people in our State they continue to talk about what has happened this past couple of years with inflation with crime with that open border with the supply chain issues They are worried about that They are worried about how that is going to affect them this year My colleague from Texas has touched on some of these issues Now in Tennessee as they look at what has transpired over the last couple of years we talked a lot about a tornado in December that ripped through Dresden TN I went into the Presbyterian church that was demolished on my last visit over there and I saw the progress they are making to rebuild that wonderful church One of the things they talked about was how inflation and supply chain bottlenecks are really thwarting their efforts to get this sanctuary finished so they can have their Easter celebration right there in that sanctuary In Waverly TN those individuals know exactly how the people over in Dresden feel because we had floods that came through Humphreys County TN devastating floods There were 20 Tennesseans who lost their lives when the floods ripped through that town destroyed that town about a year and a half ago and the town is trying to rebuild My team and I were able to help those folks there in Waverly secure a disaster declaration and the funds they needed to help get rebuilding but the same issues inflation and supply chains those things that are hurting Dresden are hurting Waverly as they try to rebuild homes and as they try to recover Now this President this administration and my Democratic colleagues have focused on big spending and little else and it has really created a minefield for our local leaders whether they are trying to rebuild or whether they are trying to expand But those issues supply chains and inflation continue to come up West Tennessee where I started my 95 county tour is experiencing massive growth Ford Motor Company is coming in there and they have a big plant a multibillion dollar investment Sonova is over in that part of the State There are other companies that are moving their operations to the area These communities are set to welcome thousands of jobs homes and new businesses but they are not ready because the existing utility infrastructure cannot support the growth and expansion that are coming into that part of our State Until recently most of this West Tennessee area was fields and small rural communities These local leaders now are seeing growth and they need to expand their utilities their water their sewer their electric power distribution and their telecom services and they are having to do it quickly as these major employers ramp up But something is standing in their way and again it is all of this government spending that has driven this inflation and the supply chain crisis that is slowing down what they need They can t get pipe to build out water and wastewater systems They can t get telephone poles If they could find a transformer to buy they wouldn t be able to afford it because the price has increased by more than 400 percent 400 percent since Joe Biden was sworn into office I know that the Biden administration has an agenda and they are willing to do whatever it takes to check these items off of their to do list They do have an agenda It is all about government control It is all about government spending It is not the agenda the people have The way people in these communities in Tennessee see it is there is a disregard for how this Federal policy as it comes down how it affects them and how it makes their future difficult It should not be this difficult to rebuild a home or run a sewer line or to finish a new road Tennesseans know this and they trust me when I meet with them to bring that message back here to DC that decisions that are made here make their life at the local level more difficult

606	Mr President I rise today to recognize the 1973 Vaster High School basketball team on the 50th anniversary of its overall state championship game performance and the way it continues to inspire many Arkansans to this day From the small rural Jefferson County community of Moscow and with a first year head coach the Vaster basketball team had a remarkable season earning the Class B title and advancing to the finals in the overall tournament Vaster defeated bigger and better teams to earn the right to play in the overall championship contest against the powerhouse players of Little Rock Central High School The Vaster squad was certainly the underdog but they played hard and kept the game close through late in the fourth quarter In the final moments they came up short but despite the crushing defeat the Vaster players held their heads high and fans rallied around these young men who proudly represented their community They revealed wisdom beyond their years in learning from the loss taking pride in all they had achieved and still displaying true sportsmanship Stories like theirs bring communities together and create memories and friendships that last a lifetime Their performance at the end of the 1973 season has forged a bond between the players coaches and spectators that still sparks passion today I applaud the coaches and players for their ability to show such grit and resilience on the court and grace in defeat By overcoming challenges they faced along their hard fought journey the Vaster team demonstrated the power of uniting to achieve a common goal Even 50 years later this game represents something bigger than just basketball in the lesson it provides anyone can face long odds and even suffer a defeat but still be considered a winner
607	Mr President in the past half century Arkansans have played millions of basketball games most of which have disappeared into a blur of fond memories and forgotten scores For many of the residents of Jefferson County however one game still stands out from the rest the 1973 State overall championship final between the Vaster High School Pirates and the Little Rock Central High School Tigers In that game the Pirates represented a small rural community of only a few hundred against the Tigers of Little Rock a city of a quarter million The Tigers were taller better ranked and were defending champs Vaster on the other hand had overcome great odds just to get to the championship final and few thought they had a chance The Pirates could have made a halfhearted effort that March day and met expectations But that is not what makes a great game and not what the Pirates had in mind When they took the court Vaster s coaches and players were intent on shattering expectations and that is exactly what they did Far from being blown out the Pirates went toe to toe with the Tigers Central would take the lead only for Vaster to wrest it away The Pirates made the Tigers fight for every pass point and inch of progress And you better believe they made Central sweat This climactic battle between two great teams ended in a one point Tiger victory after Vaster missed a free throw in the last 12 seconds of the game Fifty years later that game still fills many Arkansans with pride It remains proof that extraordinary effort commitment and drive even by teenagers on a basketball court can inspire and make a difference years later That is why I would like to honor the great coaches players and staff of the 1972 73 Vaster High School Pirates head coach Herbert Pryor assistant coach Andrew Carr Cleveland Allen Eric Biley Samuel Biley Jr Reddic Borkins Jimmy Dade Carl Evans James Evans Tommy Evans Roy Franklin Jimmy Gladney Homer Jackson Melvin Jackson Charles Petty Rodney Ryce Thomas Tarty Ronnie Grice Rodney Crawford and Jacob Jones The State of Arkansas and the U S Senate salute you on this 50th anniversary of your great game

616	Mr. Speaker I rise to speak in support of the Community Wildfire Protection Act bipartisan legislation that Senator Daines and I are reintroducing today This bill would ensure that those communities that are deemed to be under the greatest threat from wildfire are eligible to receive existing Federal wildfire grants This sounds obvious but unfortunately is not the case under current law The current definition of an at risk community was codified in the 2003 Healthy Forest Restoration Act That law requires that in addition to experiencing significant wildfire risk an eligible community must either be adjacent to Federal land or included on a list generated in 2001 consisting of voluntary input from States and Tribes Unfortunately this 2001 list is far from objective or comprehensive Communities on the list were not added based on an objective evaluation of their wildfire risk or threat to life and property only whether an individual Governor or Tribal leader decided to add them To make matters worse there are obvious omissions from the list that show its inadequacy and in fact 19 States and territories never submitted a single community For example large California cities such as Fresno Fairfield and Napa are not encompassed by this definition all of which have experienced recent major wildfires The list also omits Grizzly Flats CA which was devastated by the 2021 Caldor Fire despite its proximity to Federal lands as well as countless other small towns at great risk of wildfire These small rural towns are frequently at the highest risk of wildfire and lack the resources to undertake wildfire resiliency projects on their own Obviously these are some of the towns that would most benefit from addition Federal help but because of the outdated definition may not be eligible Aligning the definition in law for at risk communities to today s environmental realities is more important than ever given the increased spread frequency and destructiveness of wildfires especially in the West Our bill would simply end the practice of making Federal grants contingent on this outdated incomplete list or proximity to Federal lands Instead our legislation would allow communities to be eligible based on the most up to date quantitative wildfire risk data for the entire United States data already maintained by the U S Forest Service The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provided 1 billion for community wildfire resilience grants and last year s Inflation Reduction Act included an historic 1 8 billion for wildfire resilience on federal forestlands Congress has done the work of providing funding for wildfire resilience Now it must ensure that these projects can be targeted where they are most necessary and completed with the swiftness that the wildfire crisis demands I am pleased to work with Senator Daines on this commonsense bill that will save lives save communities and ensure that Federal dollars are spent as effectively as possible This change would help more communities in our home States of California and Montana and others throughout the West access Federal grants to reduce hazardous fuels around their communities and utilize authorities to complete them in a timely fashion thereby reducing the threat posed by wildfire I am proud that our bill has received the support of the National Association of Counties Rural County Representatives of California the National Association of State Foresters the Pacific Forest Trust and the California Fire Safe Council Our bill is simple but it would correct a glaring oversight in current law and ensure that billions of dollars in wildfire resiliency funding are applied where they are most needed I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation
617	Mr. Speaker I rise today to introduce the West Coast Ocean Protection Act legislation that would prohibit new oil or natural gas leases in federal waters off the coast of California Oregon and Washington I am pleased to be joined today by Senators Padilla Wyden Merkley Murray Cantwell Menendez Booker Markey and Sanders in introducing this bill which is critically important to protecting the west coast from additional oil spills Californians know all too well the devastating effects of oil spills In 1969 a well blowout on an offshore rig spilled an estimated 3 million gallons of crude oil into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Santa Barbara At the time it was the worst oil spill in U S history and was catastrophic to the local environment and marine life closing beaches harming the economy and killing thousands of birds fish and marine mammals After the Santa Barbara disaster California had enough The State blocked all new offshore drilling in state waters and in 1994 enacted a permanent offshore drilling ban Through local ordinances congressional opposition and Presidential moratoria no new drilling in Federal waters off California has been allowed since 1984 Unfortunately Californians are still confronting the impacts from ongoing offshore drilling operations In October 2021 a ruptured pipeline spilled more than 25 000 gallons of crude oil into the Pacific Ocean and onto the beaches of Orange County Despite numerous alarms operators allowed oil to flow from the leak for over 14 hours It was absolutely devastating The spill covered more than 8 000 acres of the ocean s surface and required more than a week of cleanup In that time local businesses suffered fisheries shuttered and crews worked to remove harmful oil and tar balls from sensitive wildlife habitat Despite the harm caused to individuals and businesses in the community the operator has been given permission to repair the pipeline and begin drilling again exposing the California coastline to the risk of yet another accident California s coastal and ocean economies are engines of growth that support millions of jobs and generate significant economic activity for the State and Nation Because of the unique nature of the west coast ocean shelf any new potential drilling would occur near the coastline and directly threaten the environment and robust economy Beyond that we are currently in the midst of a historic offshore energy transition This past December a successful auction was held for five offshore wind energy areas off the California coast paving the way for a new floating wind industry At the same time the Federal Government has begun a programmatic review of decommissioning oil and gas platforms in the Pacific to prepare for their eventual removal The era of offshore oil and gas production in the Pacific is coming to a close and it is long overdue It is time to respect the view of California and our fellow west coast States by passing the West Coast Ocean Protection Act permanently ban offshore drilling and protect the Pacific coast for generations to come
618	Mr. Speaker I rise today to introduce the Fighting Homelessness Through Services and Housing Act which would establish a new Federal grant program to increase capacity for comprehensive supportive services paired with housing as a way to address our country s homelessness crisis As we have seen with the growing diversity of our homeless populations individuals with mental health conditions or those struggling with addiction people who simply could not keep up with increases in rent families with children and veterans our Nation s homelessness crisis is not going away on its own without coordinated efforts at every level of government According to the data released in December from the U S Department of Housing and Urban Development there are approximately 582 500 homeless individuals including families with small children in the United States Nearly 30 percent of this population is in California with approximately 172 000 homeless people sleeping on the streets on any given night In a nation as prosperous and wealthy as ours we can and we must do better to address the issue of homelessness That is why I am introducing the Fighting Homelessness Through Services and Housing Act which would authorize a new Federal funding stream of 1 billion per year subject to annual appropriations Grantees must serve individuals or families who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless by providing housing paired with a comprehensive set of services and must provide a 25 percent match for any Federal funds received Because each individual and every community is unique the grant program would be flexible in order to work in any region or for any homeless population This bill is based on a model that has proven to be effective and supports the great work already being done across the country allowing local governmental entities and nonprofit organizations to expand their capacity and ensure a greater reach by putting Federal dollars where they will be most effective I am proud that this legislation is supported by a wide coalition of local governments housing health and child welfare organizations including the mayors and CEOs for U S Housing Investment National League of Cities National Alliance to End Homelessness National Association of Counties National Low Income Housing Coalition and the National Housing Conference Supportive services such as mental and physical health care substance abuse treatment education and job training and life skills such as financial literacy are critical components Paired with intensive case management supportive housing models make a difference We have seen the success of such partnerships in San Francisco where the GLIDE Foundation provides critical services that meet an individual s basic needs including meals crisis intervention and prevention childcare and educational programming legal advice and housing This would not be possible without the organization s partnerships with the city of San Francisco particularly the San Francisco Department of Public Health and other critical stakeholders I highly encourage my colleagues to examine this exemplary homeless services model to see firsthand how effective partnerships can help to combat homelessness It is imperative that we support these types of partnerships as well as nonprofit service providers as they work to get people into housing to both mitigate the spread of the coronavirus and address their long term needs I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the bill and moving it through the Senate especially as we continue to contend with the increase in homelessness

640	Mr Speaker I rise today in opposition to the unconstitutional Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority HISA During the 117th Congress I filed an amendment to the omnibus spending bill to strip language from the bill that had been intended to fix the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act which was found unconstitutional by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals on November 18 2022 because Congress had unlawfully delegated its lawmaking power to a private corporation called the Authority The Appeals Court said the Authority needed more oversight from the Federal Trade Commission FTC but the language included in the omnibus had been hastily put together and failed to address the underlying issue raised by the Appeals Court The so called fix still did not allow the FTC to make policy decisions The FTC still may only reject rules proposed by the Authority if they are inconsistent with the Act but the Act is written so broadly that no rule will ever be rejected After the rules have gone into effect the FTC may now issue its own rules but it still may do so only to make them consistent with the Act It cannot impose its own policy decisions on the Authority s rules Unfortunately my amendment did not receive a vote in this era of governing by omnibus but I will be working this Congress to pass legislation through regular order that will fix the constitutional problems with HISA

645	Mr Speaker today I rise to pay tribute to the strength resilience and heart of Oxford Michigan a small town that was forever changed on November 30 2021 That day the world watched in horror as news broke that a gunman had opened fire at Oxford High School killing four people and injuring eight others It was a community wide tragedy the depth and breadth of which I have never experienced and one that forever changed the trajectory of life for all those in and around Oxford But before it was a headline Oxford was a close knit town the kind of place where neighbors reach out to help neighbors where people of all ages gather at the local diner sporting Wildcat blue and gold before packing the stands for Friday night football games After the unimaginable happened Oxford was fundamentally changed clothed from head to toe in profound and overwhelming grief While that grief will never completely lift I have seen this community transform yet again through countless acts of kindness and bravery both from around the world and from right within this community because Oxford is a place where neighbors reach out to help neighbors The examples would fill a library but to share just a few the legions of Oxford businesses like Meijer Sick Pizza and Legacy Center that opened their doors to provide a safe haven for students and families and raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to support victims Their contributions both financial and emotional are too numerous to count and will never be forgotten Oxford Township President Jack Curtis and Oxford Village President Joe Madore responded immediately to the crisis and worked tirelessly to provide anything and everything they could They led their boards to channel grief into action banding together to bring every available resource local state and federal into this community And dedicated public servant C J Carnacchio used his skill and stalwart determination to tell Oxford s story playing a pivotal role in bringing meaningful benefits and resources into the community More than 30 emergency service agencies police fire and EMS rushed into the school that day and today they continue to show up to address the ongoing challenges of public safety mental health support and other needs for their own staff for the schools and for surrounding communities I continue to be amazed by the bravery and resilience of Oxford High School students many of whom have become fierce advocates for gun safety and mental health And I am in awe of the teachers and staff who define fortitude and service above self every day when despite their own pain and suffering they walk back into the building and turn their focus to their students In the days and months since the shooting I have watched leaders emerge from every corner of Oxford and through them I have seen how grief can walk hand in hand with hope stitched with an indestructible fabric of Wildcat blue and gold Because above all Oxford is a place where neighbors reach out to help neighbors It has been the honor of my life to represent this community in Congress and today while one tragic day broke Oxford s heart it did not and it will not break this community s spirit Through our collective grief and through this declaration may we forever honor the people of Oxford and the memories of Hana Tate Madisyn and Justin

650	Mr Speaker today I introduce the District of Columbia Courts Judicial Vacancy Reduction Act This bill would expedite the appointment of local D C judges The sole purpose of this bill is to protect public safety and promote justice by ending the perpetual judicial vacancy crisis in the local D C courts The longstanding judicial vacancy crisis in the local D C courts which delays resolution of criminal and civil cases has existed regardless of which party controls the presidency and Senate because presidents and senators are understandably more focused on nominees to the federal courts and the executive branch than to the local D C courts This bill has nothing to do with D C statehood or home rule Although D C will control the local D C courts when it becomes a state and Congress could and should give D C control over the local D C courts now this bill would not give D C any new authority over the local D C courts Under the D C Home Rule Act D C has no control over the organization or jurisdiction of the local D C courts including the nomination and appointment of judges A 7 member commission which is comprised of federal D C and private sector appointees submits to the president a list of 3 persons for each vacancy on the local D C courts The president must nominate and with the advice and consent of the Senate appoint 1 person from the list If the president fails to nominate 1 of the persons from the list within 60 days the commission must nominate and with the advice and consent of the Senate appoint 1 of the persons from the list This bill would not change the role of the president or the commission in the appointment of local D C judges Instead it would apply the congressional review period for D C legislation to the appointment of local D C judges Upon nomination local D C judges would be appointed after the expiration of a 30 day congressional review period unless a resolution disapproving of the appointment was enacted into law during that period Local D C judges are non Article III judges The Constitution only requires Senate approval of Article III judges that is judges on the federal district courts the federal appeals courts and the U S Supreme Court Congress has the discretion to decide how non Article III judges will be appointed and has chosen to subject some non Article III judges to Senate approval but not others For example Congress has not given itself any role in the appointment of bankruptcy or administrative law judges This bill would strike a middle ground Congress would retain the authority to block the appointment of local D C judges but it would only have a limited time period to do so I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation

661	The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona Mr Biggs for 5 minutes Mr Speaker I honor the life and legacy of Russell Pearce a constituent a colleague a patriot and a dear friend Russell passed January 5 2023 in Mesa Arizona A fifth generation Arizonan with a deep pioneer heritage Russell was born June 23 1947 to Hal and Norma Pearce in Mesa Arizona Russell had humble roots but was raised by a loving hardworking mother who taught him that he could make his own path in the world Driven by his faith he knew that the principles of our divinely inspired founding documents established the United States of America as a bastion of liberty and peace This belief ignited a sense of duty that led Russell to a life of success through service to his community his State and his country He first answered the call to serve in 1965 when he joined the Arizona National Guard during the Vietnam conflict He served honorably until 1972 and in the interim joined the Maricopa County Sheriff s Office being sworn in as a deputy in 1970 Law enforcement was in Russell s blood as his ancestor Joe Pearce had been one of the original Arizona Rangers Two of his own sons Sean and Colten have followed Russell s example joining the MCSO and also the Gilbert Police Department respectively In protecting his community Russell demonstrated unrivaled toughness courage and dedication to duty In 1977 while pursuing known gang members through a Phoenix suburb one of them turned and fired Russell was shot through the hand and chest losing a finger However though wounded Russell raced after the criminals and arrested them before seeking medical treatment He received the Medal of Valor for his actions the department s highest honor Russell s tenacity and excellence led to steady promotions eventually reaching the level of captain After his first stint at MCSO Russell was elected to his public office as justice of the peace for Mesa s new north justice district in 1991 He earned a reputation of trust from Mesa s citizens and public officials He rejoined MCSO when he was appointed MCSO s chief deputy in 1993 by America s toughest sheriff Joe Arpaio Serving as chief deputy for the largest law enforcement organization in Arizona and the fourth largest in the United States was a monumental task Russell developed not only a love of but a true talent for public policy He crafted and successfully implemented major reforms aimed at cutting millions in taxpayer costs and reducing offender recidivism His success as chief deputy led to his appointment as director of the Arizona Governor s Office of Highway Safety where he led the Motor Vehicle Division He created ServiceArizona com a first in the Nation web service that made registration faster and simpler for Arizona motorists and exponentially reduced wait times and costs Of course Russell is best known nationally and locally for his work in the Arizona State Legislature He served for 11 years representing North Mesa in the Arizona State House first and then the Arizona Senate While in the senate Russell demonstrated the foresight to tackle the biggest challenges facing Arizona and its citizens I was honored to serve with him and call him my friend and colleague Russell authored and introduced important legislation designed to shrink government Ultimately he was elected senate president and worked steadfastly to advance legislation that promoted the principles and values important to Arizonans the right to life the sanctity of marriage defense of our southern border and reverence for the Constitution and God given liberties At times Russell s courage to bring these issues to the front placed Arizona in front of national issues such as the passage of S B 1070 which allowed among other provisions State and local enforcement of immigration law That took foresight It took immense courage to be the face of that legislation Russell Pearce was ahead of his time With the current overwhelming crisis at our southern border we see that States take the brunt of the consequences when the Federal Government fails to enforce our laws and protect our citizens Millions of Arizonans are freer safer and more prosperous thanks to Russell Pearce s courageous and farsighted leadership in addressing difficult public policies Freedom loving Americans across this great country enjoy the fruits of his efforts thanks to their respective States modeling legislation after those crafted under Russell s leadership His professional and political legacy is truly unmatched and is only outshone by his love of God and service to his church his loyalty to the country he loved and most importantly his beautiful family that survives him his wife LuAnne his 5 children and 13 grandchildren To quote Russell himself You know where my heart is You know it is with this great Republic of ours and its freedom loving citizens I believe God had His hand in making America We have the greatest document ever written by wise and virtuous men and the greatest country in the world because of freedom loving people like you the freedom loving people of America I for one will continue to fight to protect your freedoms from government encroachment It is America s commitment to that freedom personal responsibility and moral government that makes us strong Rest in peace Russell and God bless LuAnne and the Pearce family

664	Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr Speaker Congress is charged with overseeing the executive branch This includes overseeing the general management and operations of government agencies For the success of our government s missions and Federal programs we must have a competent and skilled workforce to deliver services to the American people defend our Nation and execute the laws passed by Congress However agencies lack the tools to identify and hire the best candidates to fill these positions The problem is that hiring for the Federal civil service has over relied on the paper credentials and self administered job proficiency assessments of candidates The reintroduced Chance to Compete Act of 2023 ensures agencies use objective skills based assessments to evaluate job candidates The private sector already uses such structured interviews knowledge tests and writing samples for the hiring process It is time for the Federal Government to do so as well Agencies should be able to hire professionals that can do the work and there are many ways to build the right kind of professional expertise H R 159 represents one of those rare bipartisan legislative reforms that targets a specific problem implements tested solutions and reflects private sector best practices The bill codifies and improves upon the policy initiatives begun in the Trump administration and which the Biden administration is continuing to implement I thank the chairwoman of the Committee on Education and Workforce Dr Virginia Foxx who is also a senior member of the House Oversight Committee and Congressman Gerry Connolly for working quickly to ready this bipartisan bill I also thank Representative Ro Khanna for again supporting this bill that will help us modernize our government I hope that our Senate colleagues can swiftly advance this important legislation so that it can be signed into law this year Mr Speaker I urge my colleagues to support this important bill and I reserve the balance of my time
665	Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr Speaker I rise in support of H R 159 the Chance to Compete Act The bipartisan Chance to Compete Act was introduced by Representative Foxx who I see is here with us and Representative Connolly I thank them both for their hard work on it The bill aims to make evaluations more useful in assessing the skills of candidates for Federal positions and to alleviate inefficiencies that have long hampered the hiring process The bill turns away from current reliance on self assessment and attainment of educational degrees to determine candidate qualifications in the hiring process Instead subject matter experts and agencies would design assessments that test specific knowledge for a position for which the agency is hiring This overhaul would better match qualified applicants with positions and expand opportunities to candidates with more diverse professional and educational backgrounds The Chance to Compete Act aligns with the Office of Personnel Management s guidance of last May to facilitate an executive order to modernize the process of hiring Federal job candidates Establishing hiring methods that are more skills based will improve agency managers ability to hire people who possess the knowledge and experience to do the job and to hire from a wider array of qualified applicants The bill also directs OPM to create an online platform for sharing candidate assessments between agencies and maintain a portal for hiring managers to find candidates who have already demonstrated their qualifications for certain positions but were not yet hired Under this legislation agencies may assemble talent teams to support this assessment of candidates in the hiring process The OPM Director would be required to submit annual progress reports to Congress on use of the new assessments After 5 years the GAO would conduct a study of the implementation of the Federal job assessment reforms and their impacts on the hiring process This bill streamlines the hiring process for agencies and will shorten the time it takes to bring new well qualified employees on board I thank Dr Foxx for her leadership in introducing it The bill is the result of constructive collaboration by several members of our committee from both sides of the aisle including Mr Connolly Mr Speaker I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this bipartisan measure and I reserve the balance of my time
666	Mr Speaker I thank my colleague for yielding Mr Speaker Republicans and Democrats can agree that every hardworking taxpaying American deserves a Federal Government that is built upon a solid foundation that breathes efficiency and is peopled by those with appropriate skills not necessarily degrees To achieve that end we must eliminate the bureaucratic snares that have hamstrung the Federal hiring process over the course of decades and fast In its current state this dilapidated and archaic hiring process serves as a deterrent to attracting qualified and high quality candidates The simple truth is that it seriously undermines the Federal workforce s ability to serve the American people in both a proper and efficient manner Mr Speaker it is clear that something must be done to turn the tide That is precisely why I have introduced the Chance to Compete Act of 2023 alongside Representative Gerry Connolly Oversight and Accountability Committee Chairman James Comer and Representative Ro Khanna This legislation builds upon a solid record of bipartisan collaboration and proven success in codifying key skills based hiring reforms More specifically under this legislation Federal agencies will be able better to distinguish practical performers in a field of candidates and focus on hiring individuals who can perform at the highest level in the jobs they assume within the Federal Government Mr Speaker I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this much needed bipartisan legislation
667	Mr Speaker I yield myself the balance of my time for closing Mr Speaker I urge everyone to support passage of this bipartisan legislation It is an auspicious way for us to begin on the Oversight Committee I salute the chairman for his wisdom in bringing this forward and I yield back the balance of my time
668	Mr Speaker this is a commonsense bill aimed at hiring applicants for Federal positions based on whether they have the relevant skills to do the job The American people deserve nothing less from their Federal Government Mr Speaker I encourage my colleagues to support this bill and I yield back the balance of my time
669	Mr Speaker I rise in support of H R 159 the Chance to Compete Act of 2023 as amended that implements merit based reforms to the civil service hiring system and would replace degree based hiring with skills and competency based hiring It is critically important that we make skills and competency based hiring the fundamental method of assessment for hiring in the competitive civil service No person with the requisite skill training and competency should be prevented from securing a job because of a requirement that they hold a higher education degree As modern industry and technology evolve so too do the pathways to professional achievement Recently apprenticeship programs are an increasingly viable alternative to a traditional degree as they give students new opportunities to gain both knowledge of the subject matter and a skill set tailored specifically to their chosen profession These programs allow them to pursue jobs which align with their passions and strengths while still providing the students with important recognition in the form of a certificate which demonstrates their expertise in the field Undeniably these skills focused models have opened doors for many who have been marginalized economically giving them access to well deserved dignity and success within their communities It is past time that the competitive civil service do away with degree requirements and make skills and competency based hiring the fundamental method of assessment This change will expand the pipeline of candidates who can access the competitive civil service jobs I have long been a champion of education and workforce development Several institutions in my district including Houston Independent School District Lone Star College and Houston Community College have very successful trade and skills and based training programs These programs cover the gamut from culinary arts to auto mechanic programs to certificate programs for estheticians In 2017 Hurricane Harvey killed 67 people flooded 154 000 homes and 500 000 vehicles and inflicted 125 billion in damage primarily from catastrophic rainfall triggering the worst flooding in the Houston metropolitan area history In the aftermath I advocated for funding for Houston Community College for a water disaster resilience training certification and onboarding of skills technologies and training for first responders and the public to better prepare for the unique challenges posed by massive urban flood events This and other programs offer the opportunity to gain practical and in demand skills needed to build a successful career in todays economy The Chance to Compete Act of 2023 will open new pathways for those without a degree and allow them to access job roles in the competitive civil service that may have otherwise been inaccessible which gives them the opportunity to advance their lives and careers Furthermore access to jobs in the competitive civil service based on skill and competency will grant people an unprecedented level of access to the dignity of work that fulfills a great need in today s society We must remain committed to recognizing the power and potential of non degree based assessments for access to new employment paths especially in light of today s changing job market
670	Mr Speaker the civil service is the lifeblood of our government and provides taxpayers small businesses and vulnerable populations vital resources and services throughout the country As Chairman of the Subcommittee on Government Operations for the past 4 years I held a series of hearings focused on revitalizing and rejuvenating the federal workforce What we found is that proposals like Chance to Compete should exist in a constellation of improvements to federal workforce recruitment that includes better pay reforming federal internships to improve the intern to employee pipeline and remaining competitive with the private sector in areas such as hybrid work all of which are the subjects of legislation produced by the Government Operations Subcommittee last Congress FAIR Act Next Gen Feds Act and Telework and Metrics Cost Savings Act I am proud to be the lead cosponsor of the Chance to Compete Act which leverages skill assessments to build a more competitive equitable and inclusive workforce This bill has bipartisan support and through demonstration projects at agencies proven empirical success In short this legislation allows an agency that has an open position to develop a skills based assessment to evaluate candidates in a way that goes above and beyond the traditional review of past work and education experience Furthermore this bill Enables agencies to share their assessment findings with other agencies streamlining the overall hiring process and ensuring competitive candidates do not fall between the cracks if they have already proven their ability to perform And deploys talent teams at agencies to ensure the development and implementation of the goals of this bill I thank Representative Virginia Foxx for her hard work and leadership on this bill as well as the American Federation of Government Employees AFGE Partnership for Public Service PPS the Senior Executives Association SEA Professional Managers Association PMA and others who have endorsed this legislation
671	Will the gentleman from South Carolina Mr Wilson come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance Mr WILSON of South Carolina led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all
672	Mr Speaker last year was difficult for the American family Under disastrous policies of Biden and the Democrat led Congress inflation reached 40 year highs causing everyday prices to skyrocket December marked the 21st straight month that inflation was higher than real wages As a result Americans are relying on credit cards as payment and nearly half are carrying debt from month to month up 39 percent from last year according to Bankrate Credit card balances increased 15 percent versus last year the largest increase in more than 20 years according to a recent quarterly report of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York When Biden took office in 2021 inflation was 1 4 percent but it has risen nearly 14 percent since then destroying jobs The House Republican majority is committed to fighting inflation and lowering the cost of living creating jobs In conclusion God bless our troops who successfully protected America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues moving from the Afghanistan safe haven to America Our sympathy to the family of Tom Young Sr of Aiken South Carolina
673	Mr Speaker today I come before the House of Representatives to honor the legacy of Captain Johnathan Benton Captain Benton tragically lost his life on January 16 2023 in a small plane crash Johnathan was a man of service He served our country faithfully for over 25 years in the Air Force During that time he was a command pilot with over 4 000 hours in the C 130 and KC 135 He was also an instructor and evaluator pilot He spent over 750 days deployed in support of conflicts in Bosnia Afghanistan and Iraq He eventually retired as a lieutenant colonel in the U S Air Force s Air National Guard for the State of Oklahoma After his time in the military Johnathan served as the Government Affairs Committee chairman for CAPA as well as the Allied Pilots Association Johnathan never stopped serving our country Through his role as chairman for CAPA and APA he continued to advocate on behalf of Americans To his wife Bridget and two children Nathan and Ashlynn Marie I am truly sorry Your husband and father was a great man He had a great big heart and loved you all dearly What he gave our country cannot be summed up in a 1 minute speech but the legacy he leaves and the good works he has done will last forever
674	Mr Speaker I rise today in defense of the Second Amendment which is once again under attack by the unelected Federal bureaucrats in Washington The Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives is seeking to reclassify firearms with pistol braces as short barreled rifles a classification which threatens to make criminals of tens of millions of law abiding Americans who have already purchased these The extra red tape fees and registrations that the ATF wants to require is an unnecessary punishment for shooting enthusiasts who purchased perfectly legal accessories to their legal firearms This follows a long pattern we have seen for decades in Washington s antigun unconstitutional policies which could never make it through Congress as a law that is imposed upon the public through the rule making process Americans are tired of unelected Federal agencies spending their tax dollars attacking and curtailing the constitutional rights of law abiding citizens
675	Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX the Chair will postpone further proceedings today on motions to suspend the rules on which a recorded vote or the yeas and nays are ordered or votes objected to under clause 6 of rule XX The House will resume proceedings on postponed questions at a later time
676	Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr Speaker I rise in support of H R 300 the Settlement Agreement Information Database Act Transparency and public participation are vital to ensure the public s continued trust in our government Federal agencies frequently use settlement agreements to resolve litigation without going through lengthy public trials However it is impossible for Congress and the public to determine the impact these settlement agreements have on State and local governments and private sector entities because they must continue to follow the agency requirements these agreements mandate Such secret negotiations and agreements essentially prevent the public from participating in important policy decisions These Federal settlements agreements impose a tremendous burden They are often difficult to see and hard to understand Further State and local governments industry stakeholders and taxpayers can be directly affected by the settlements for years yet they can t provide input This legislation seeks to correct that problem The Settlement Agreement Information Database Act or SAID Act requires Federal agencies to submit information regarding consent decrees and settlement agreements to a public electronic database This public resource to be overseen by the Office of Management and Budget will include dates payments attorney s fees awards and a list of State and local governments and other entities impacted by each settlement Currently agencies release information about settlements at their discretion and will only publicize the facts that reflect favorably upon the agency Furthermore the terms of the settlement agreements are often deemed confidential Under the requirements of the SAID Act if an agency believes that information regarding an agreement should remain confidential the agency head must publish an explanation of why it is confidential This will increase transparency and shine a much needed light on agency settlement agreements I thank my Committee on Oversight and Accountability colleagues Gary Palmer and Gerry Connolly for preparing this important legislation for consideration today Mr Speaker I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this commonsense legislation and I reserve the balance of my time
677	Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr Speaker I do indeed support this significant commonsense and bipartisan legislation I thank the chairman again and I thank Representatives Palmer and Connolly for their hard work on it The Settlement Agreement Information Database Act will create a database of settlement agreements entered into by Federal agencies relating to alleged violations of Federal civil or criminal law The OMB will manage the database and set deadlines for submission The heads of executive agencies will be required to submit details about the types of settlement agreements they have entered into the parties who are actually involved in them the specific violations and the dates upon which such settlement agreements were made All information about the settlement agreements would remain public until 5 years after they terminate The information in the agreements would remain subject to the Freedom of Information Act but if the head of the agency decided to keep an entire agreement confidential he or she would be required to provide a specific explanation of that action This legislation will substantially improve the transparency surrounding so many settlement agreements which in the past have been very difficult for the public to access or even to find Transparency is of course central to the rule of law Mr Speaker I reserve the balance of my time
678	Mr Speaker I rise in support of H R 300 the Settlement Agreement Information Database Act The principle of open government is a hallmark of our system of governing dating as far back as the Enlightenment The open government doctrine maintains that citizens have a right to access the Federal Government s records and operations to facilitate oversight of the public business Open government principles are key to fulfilling the promise of a nation ruled by the consent of the governed Open government requires transparency and public participation which are vital to ensure the public s continued trust in our government Increasingly however Federal agencies have entered into legally binding settlement agreements to resolve litigation without going through lengthy public trials that often provide the transparency Unfortunately agencies generally release limited information about these settlements When information is published it is usually in the form of a press release focused more on self promoting than informing Furthermore Federal agencies can unilaterally deem the terms of a settlement agreement confidential with no explanation Such secret negotiations and agreements prevent the public from participating in important policy decisions made on their behalf As a result it is impossible for Congress and the public to determine the comprehensive impact of these settlement agreements on State and local governments private sector entities and taxpayers These parties are often barred from providing input but must continue to follow the mandated requirements which often remain in effect for decades Today I am pleased to join my colleagues on both sides of the aisle as we take this first step to correct this problem The Settlement Agreement Information Database Act or the SAID Act will increase the transparency of the Federal Government and shine a much needed light on settlement agreements The bill requires Federal agencies to submit information regarding settlement agreements to a public electronic database This public resource to be overseen by the Office of Management and Budget would include dates payments attorney s fees awards and a list of States municipalities and other entities impacted by these settlements Under the requirements of the SAID Act if the agency believes that the information regarding an agreement should remain confidential the agency head must publish an explanation of why it is confidential Mr Speaker I thank my colleagues for supporting this bipartisan legislation They include Chairman Comer Ranking Member Raskin Representatives Ami Bera Scott Peters Andy Barr and French Hill I especially thank my colleague across the aisle Representative Gerry Connolly for his leadership in introducing this bill jointly with me In a time when Americans feel divided it is important to come together to support commonsense good government legislation I am happy we could once again expedite its consideration in the House and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this commonsense legislation
679	Mr Speaker first of all let me express my appreciation to the members of this committee Gerry Connolly and then to look at my friend Mr Raskin I am delighted to be on the floor with him and delighted to be on the floor with the manager of this legislation as well Mr Speaker I rise in support of H R 300 the Settlement Agreement Information Database Act of 2023 which would help increase the transparency of executive agencies to the public and allow the public to hold the government accountable This is the people s House We were just discussing even today the enormity of the work that we have done in the powerful infrastructure bill the CHIPS bill and the Inflation Reduction Act But if there are aspects of a bill that should be directed to the people if there is information that lets them have a fullness of what has happened on behalf of the American people what have we accomplished
680	Mr Speaker H R 300 would make public certain information included in settlement agreements entered into by executive agencies by establishing a public database for the reporting of agreements that cover alleged violation of civil or criminal law The information that will be disclosed to the public include what type of settlement it is any costs of money involved in the settlement agreement what State and local governments are affected by the settlements and the duration and modifications of such This ties into my point earlier of knowing information about what is going on in the government in terms of our legislation This specifically provides the information to families and businesses and communities if there has been a settlement on a matter that they are interested in True transparency is for the government to be known by American citizens on everything we do and one of the most hidden is the idea of settlements of cases Maybe it has impacted a city an individual a family a school and it is important to know what these agreements are Mr Speaker I am very pleased to have this legislation in the name of transparency and I rise to support H R 300 and I ask my colleagues to support it enthusiastically as well Mr Speaker I rise today in support of H R 300 the Settlement Agreement Information Database Act of 2023 which would help increase transparency of executive agencies to the public and allow the people to hold the government accountable H R 300 would make public certain information included in settlement agreements entered into by Executive agencies by establishing a public database for the reporting of agreements that cover alleged violation of Federal civil or criminal law The information that will be disclosed to the public include the following what the type of settlement agreement it is who is involved any costs or money involved in the settlement agreement what state and local governments are affected by the settlement agreements the duration and modifications of the settlement agreement and any justifications for the settlement agreement This bill also allows for confidentiality in situations where the interests of the confidentiality provision would protect public interest An information database is important in the oversight of executive agencies to ensure they are properly carrying out and enforcing laws we have passed As a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee this information would be vital to the security of the country This information is important in knowing what secret deals are being made that relate to the violation of federal civil or criminal law and to whom and where settlement payments are being sent H R 300 is a crucial step in protecting democracy By making settlement agreements public information the public will feel more confident that there are no secret deals to cover bad behavior by corrupt government officials Additionally this act serves as a deterrent for potential bad behavior in any government agency because the information database would ensure that bad behavior could not be hidden We work in an office of public trust and the best way to ensure that the people trust us and listen to us is to be as transparent as possible in any actions we take H R 300 helps the people to keep the government and check and hold us accountable By becoming transparent in how settlements are paid taxpayers can be confident in how their money is being spent and what ways settlement agreements are impacting fiscal health It is important that we know the financial burden these settlements have on state and local governments The people deserve to be informed on where their money is being put and how that affects their communities and public services This way when the people feel violated or that a community issue is not addressed they can better advocate for themselves and participate in the democratic process As elected officials our job is to make sure we are helping our constituents and advocating for their issues If we limit information we are stopping our citizens from getting the help they need from us or understanding who they should hold accountable for a problem That would be a detriment to democracy H R 300 is necessary because it is an important step in creating government transparency which is crucial to the democratic process
681	Mr Speaker I would say in closing that I was moved by what Mr Palmer had to say that democracy is based on consent and consent is based on access but there is no access if you don t have transparency I think about something that James Madison said And a people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives So people need to have knowledge of everything that our government is doing We don t want government entities entering into secret sweetheart settlements with different litigants It has got to be open to the whole public Mr Speaker I thank him and I thank the chairman for bringing this forward and I yield back the balance of my time
682	Mr Speaker I am happy we could expedite the Settlement Agreement Information Database Act s consideration today This Chamber has passed the SAID Act with broad support three separate times in the 115th 116th and 117th Congresses It is time the Senate acted on this important legislation Mr Speaker I urge my colleagues to support this necessary bipartisan legislation and I yield back the balance of my time
683	Mr Speaker I rise today in support of the Settlement Agreement Information Database Act which I m co leading with my colleague from Alabama Mr Palmer This bipartisan legislation was considered under suspension and agreed to in the House of Representatives by a voice vote in previous Congresses I am glad to note that the first couple of bills from the Oversight and Accountability Committee coming to the Floor in the 118th Congress are bipartisan measures That continues the tradition from the 117th Congress when the first bill on the Floor from the Oversight Committee was the FedRAMP Authorization Act 117th a bipartisan bill I wrote co led and passed with now Chairman James Comer Federal settlement agreements negotiated behind closed doors cannot continue to be shrouded in secrecy when they directly affect States municipalities and local stakeholders The SAID Act bring these binding agreements into the light by requiring federal agencies to publicly publish their documents or provide the public with written justification to keep the records confidential Details of the settlement agreements would remain public until 5 years after the termination of the agreements Increased transparency and better intergovernmental collaboration help form the foundation of good government and this bill is one more tool to ensure government accountability I am a former local government official who served on the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors for 14 years including 5 years as Chairman I currently chair the Congressional Caucus on Former Local Elected Officials and I have authorized legislation the Restore the Partnership Act which would revive the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations I am committed to enhancing the intergovernmental partnership which often entails requiring the federal government to be more transparent and proactive in its relationship with local governments When it comes to settlement agreements that have the potential of tying the hands of local governments on everything from stormwater management to public education the default should be transparency I welcome this bipartisan legislation urge my colleagues to support it and ask the Senate to act on this bill
684	Proceedings will resume on questions previously postponed Votes will be taken in the following order Motions to suspend the rules and pass H R 159 and H R 300 and Agreeing to the Speaker s approval of the Journal if ordered The first electronic vote will be conducted as a 15 minute vote Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX remaining electronic votes will be conducted as 5 minute votes
685	Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX the unfinished business is the vote on the motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill H R 159 to implement merit based reforms to the civil service hiring system that replace degree based hiring with skills and competency based hiring and for other purposes as amended on which the yeas and nays were ordered

687	Mr Speaker I rise today to remember the life of Cecil Abarr a beloved member of Wesley Monumental United Methodist Church who recently passed away at the age of 93 Cecil was born in Iowa in 1929 and upon his graduation from high school he enlisted in the U S Army during World War II After his service he was awarded the World War II Victory Medal Cecil was also a leader in the private sector locating to Savannah to become the president of the Branigar Corporation In this position he led the development of large real estate projects which have now been flourishing for decades Despite all titles and awards he received throughout his life he is best known as a husband to his wife Lou a father to his five children a grandfather to 16 and great grandfather to 21 I pass on my sincerest condolences to his family and friends He will be dearly missed
688	Mr Speaker I rise today to discuss smoking in the House of Representatives In yet another self serving move the Republicans have allowed smoking in House offices It violates local and Federal law and threatens public health In the last few decades secondhand smoke has killed more than 2 5 million Americans It causes heart disease lung cancer and strokes and it is extremely dangerous to children Local and Federal laws ban smoking in public and Federal buildings and many studies have shown that there is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke It is a life threatening decision that proves Republicans do not care about the health and safety of Americans They write the laws but don t follow them
689	Mr Speaker the benefits of school choice cannot be overstated On average students participating in school choice programs perform better academically and see higher college admission rates These factors make school choice a no brainer and charter schools serve as a foundational cornerstone of the educational freedom school choice delivers Yet even as many traditional government run schools do not meet the needs of students President Biden is erecting unreasonable barriers for new charter schools and arbitrary funding restrictions This is an abject attempt to expand teachers unions monopoly over K 12 education A great education is a gateway to success but Democrats are working hard to lock that gate and hide the key Students deserve the opportunity to find a learning environment that suits them That begins by ending Democrats anticharter school crusade
690	Mr Speaker I rise to celebrate the valorous life of Lieutenant Colonel Harold Brown of Catawba Island Ohio who recently took his final flight to the heavens Since sixth grade Harold s dream was to be a pilot By the age of 19 he made that dream a reality as a Tuskegee Airman Harold served as an exemplary officer in the U S Army Air Corps completing dozens of combat missions during World War II Once while on a mission his plane was shot down and Harold was taken as a prisoner of war This experience did not deter his service to our country Harold served again during the brutal Korean War Truly he embodied the spirit of his Spit Fire legendary airmen Harold s devotion to his country extended beyond the battlefield He worked to desegregate the military He worked as a teacher to inspire new generations of students His life was dedicated to service beyond self Today America honors Harold for his service We remember what an impact his life had and our prayers are with his loved ones Truly one human being can change the direction of the world for the better and Harold Brown did that
691	Mr Speaker I rise today to recognize National Religious Freedom Day which was celebrated last week on January 16 Religious Freedom Day commemorates the Virginia General Assembly s adoption of Thomas Jefferson s landmark Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom on January 16 1786 The statute became the basis for the First Amendment of the U S Constitution and led to freedom of religion for all Americans We are blessed to live in a country where a person is able to practice whatever religion they so choose without fear of persecution from government The First Amendment protects freedom of religion along with the freedom of speech and the freedom of the press This assurance of freedom gives us all the opportunity to openly practice and speak our beliefs and allows me to speak on the House floor right now The United States is a place where all faiths can be peacefully practiced free from fear of persecution The very foundation of our Nation a place of freedom and liberty for all was conceived by individuals in search of religious freedom Mr Speaker the United States of America will always be a beacon of light in the world and we will always protect our fundamental unified commitment of religious freedom
692	Mr Speaker God created all children with unique skills and talents We should encourage flexibility in learning to allow each student s gifts to flourish so they can live the American Dream On this National School Choice Week we must empower America s families to have a voice enabling them to choose a learning environment that is just right for their children one that will both challenge that student and encourage them to develop their God given talents Sadly our schoolchildren are facing years worth of learning and development loss which is why education freedom today is so important According to polling done by the American Federation for Children 72 percent of voters polled support school choice highlighting broad bipartisan support on this issue A ZIP code should never determine a child s future As a member of the House Education and the Workforce Committee I am committed to advancing the cause of school choice this Congress I call on my colleagues on both sides to join me and to do the same
693	Mr Speaker I rise on behalf of every American child who is going to bed tonight hungry I rise on behalf of the food insecure child and the meal insecure child Pandemic era lunch programs have expired and that number is now 10 million That is more than the entire populations of New York City Washington D C and Detroit combined I was meeting with the school administrators of Farmington Hills and they were telling me 40 percent of our children are food insecure This is impacting Oakland County Michigan We have a bill to address this as we did last term in the Congress the Healthy Meals Healthy Kids Act Let s get this passed Let s work together My colleagues are talking about school choice Let s make sure that when students go to school they have lunch guaranteed
694	Mr Speaker today I rise to oppose New York State s disastrous congestion pricing tax which is nothing more than a tax grab hurting middle class and working class families in my district especially those first responders who are forced to commute into New York City by car It would cost them an additional 5 000 a year to commute to work 23 a day just to get into Midtown Manhattan Rockland County where I live faces a 40 million value gap We pay 40 million more in taxes to the MTA system than services we receive We have no one seat ride option from Rockland County and express rail service has been cut In Westchester Putnam and Dutchess Counties commuters have received a 10 percent cut in express rail service Many folks choose not to take the subway anymore because of the rise in crime Violent felonies are up over 40 percent on the subways in New York City That is why I joined Congressman Gottheimer from New Jersey in cosponsoring the Anti Congestion Tax Act We will hold the MTA accountable and end this program stopping it dead in its tracks
695	Mr Speaker I rise today to champion the American economy and to voice my support for American workers and businesses I have just returned from a busy district work period back in west Michigan where I saw firsthand the need for a champion on economic revitalization The district I represent has long been known for manufacturing and industry Many global companies started right in west Michigan out of garages and storefronts driven by their local communities and supported by their representatives in government but we all see firsthand the difficult economic times that are taking their toll on our communities and across the United States Just last year my district alone lost dozens of small businesses This is unacceptable and it is why I am committed to moving the American economy forward in Congress It is so important that we both Republicans and Democrats support American industry and our economy It is not only the right thing to do it is what our constituents expect us to do We have so much in common here and I believe that both parties can come together and support American ingenuity and innovation Let s get to work
696	Mr Speaker the consequences of Roe have been nothing short of devastating Reporting data indicates that nearly 64 million souls have perished since the fateful decision in 1973 I want to take this 50th anniversary a dark moment in our history and turn it into an opportunity to remind my fellow Americans of the gift of life a gift that I have been so blessed and fortunate to witness My greatest joy has been the birth of my two children Madeline and Oliver In October we welcomed our son Oliver Theodore who was a month early after my wife Erin had a very debilitating and uncertain pregnancy As we spent time in the NICU we were blessed that our little boy got stronger every single day He is now very healthy We also saw those parents in the NICU that were praying for their babies survival after deliveries at 23 weeks We witnessed the true miracle of life and the power of life We must be a Nation that cherishes life and gives support to women facing unintended pregnancies Every soul has value and purpose and it is my pledge that my work in this distinguished body will be to fervently and faithfully protect the unborn
697	Mr Speaker today I rise to wish one of my constituents from my hometown of Anaheim Ms Margaret Marie Peters a very happy 94th birthday Margaret was born in the year of the Great Crash From an early age she wanted to learn and her grandmother taught her how to read and write She graduated first in her high school class and she was the first to graduate from high school in her family Later Margaret married a decorated World War II marine Together they raised five daughters in Anaheim In her forties she attended college classes It was something she always wanted to do Later on Margaret spent 29 years working for Disneyland Margaret will turn 94 on February 2 and she has witnessed many changes in this great country Clearly the United States today has come a long way since 1929 Margaret happy birthday to you and many more
698	Mr Speaker I stand tonight to offer my support for the National School Choice Week Our public education system is in dire need of reform School administrators seem to prioritize indoctrinating students with critical race theory and other leftwing ideology not even actually teaching them reading writing or math As a result our students scores in these subjects are far below other nations in the past Schools are clearly failing to prepare our children for success Instead they are hiding their agenda from parents who have a right to know Parents have the right to know and they only want the best for their children They want to put them in better schools and they want to have the choice to do so National School Choice Week gives parents the option and flexibility to place their children in an institution that best fits the child s needs and their values It is a simple popular solution to fix our failing public education system School choice will incentivize public schools to compete for each student by offering a quality education that will improve their prospects for future success If the public education system doesn t work for students it is time to reform it so that it does
699	Mr Speaker we have another issue I think that this body ought to take up and that the news media ought to be looking into and that is another cost of the huge number of illegal immigrants entering this country It has been brought to my attention by property developers that we already have a shortage of over 4 million rental units or residential units in the country When we let in another 2 million people a year what do you think happens It further causes a shortage of rental units and sometimes single family units in this country which results in what The law of supply and demand is driving up rents because of all the people coming in the country We know already a huge new expense for schools as we have to educate illegals We know about President Biden s vow to pay for free healthcare for illegals which he is fulfilling But for the individual looking for rental units is their rent going up 100 200 or 300 as we continue to have this shortage It is time the press got on this issue It is time that the Congress got on this issue and let people know particularly in the southern United States if your rents are going up it is because of all these people that are being allowed in the country
700	Mr Speaker I rise today to mark the 50th anniversary of Roe v Wade Abortion is one of the greatest tragedies in our Nation and Roe v Wade opened the door for abortions on demand until birth Over the last five decades more than 60 million unborn lives have been taken and a tragic irreversible mark has been left on countless mothers fathers and families While there is still so much work to be done I stand here hopeful The pro life community is stronger than ever With last year s Dobbs v Jackson decision this country is beginning to move in the right direction to defend the defenseless and support life We are changing hearts and minds Of course we still have a long way to go in this fight and I am proud that one of the first things that we voted on in this Congress was the born alive act to protect babies who have survived an attempted abortion I am also proud to have introduced two bills to help protect the unborn women and taxpayers the Defund Planned Parenthood Act which I was asked to carry by former Congresswoman Vickie Hartzler who carried the bill in the last Congress and the Protecting Life and Taxpayers Act We know that Americans across the country value the lives of the precious unborn babies and it is just wrong to force them to spend their tax dollars on something that goes against their most closely held values This evening I am pleased to be joined by so many champions of the unborn to celebrate the victories with many more to come Mr Speaker I yield to the gentleman from Texas Mr Cloud who is championing the efforts with Chairman Bost to end taxpayer funded abortions at the VA He has been a lead sponsor of the Women s Public Health and Safety Act which gives States the authority to exclude abortion providers like Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid funds
701	Mr Speaker Friday thousands of Americans participated in the March for Life in support of the most vulnerable in our society who have no voice the preborn Today we continue to recognize the dignity of every individual and fight for the most fundamental right of all the right to life Our instincts were always right Science has revealed it is not just a clump of cells in the womb At 15 weeks babies suck their thumbs kick jump have fully developed hearts and can feel pain What looks like a baby in the womb revealed to us through ultrasound technology is in fact a baby when they are born The radical Roe v Wade decision was based on bad science and bad jurisprudence and I am grateful that it was overturned Now is the time where we as a Nation must continue to build a culture that respects life and recognizes the God given dignity of every individual and that first unalienable right the right to life Despite the terror tactics we have seen come from pro abortionists burning and vandalizing pregnancy centers and churches the pro life movement has not winced Pregnancy centers across the country continue operating providing mothers with true healthcare and they are saving lives Mr Speaker I join with these and millions across our Nation in serving as a voice for the voiceless I along with my fellow colleagues here will continue to work to advance legislation that protects the preborn and the right to life
702	Mr Speaker I rise today to celebrate the 1 year anniversary of the overturning of the Roe v Wade decision A year ago the Supreme Court has decided to allow the States to handle the issue of abortion themselves ending more than 49 years of heartbreaking Federal precedent When we celebrate pro life victories like this we should not do so in a way that causes emotional pain to those women who have had an abortion nor should we back down from being unapologetically pro life I believe that abortion as a matter of convenience or everyday birth control is flatout wrong I would like to recognize the contributions of pro life pregnancy centers throughout our Nation that offer compassionate support and care to women as they choose to become mothers and bring life into this world The Palmetto Women s Center in my district is focused on uniting hope health and healing to women as they bring children into the world The center is working to lower the number of abortions in South Carolina and supporting women as they choose life for their children I applaud the work that pro life centers are doing and I will continue to be an advocate for all that they do Although giving the power on how to handle the issues of abortion back to the States through the favorable Dobbs ruling is a big win it does not mean the work of the pro life movement is done Action at the State and local level will only grow in importance in the coming years I will continue to be a voice for the voiceless
703	Mr Speaker as our country grapples with how to respond to this pressing moment facing women families and children I believe we must strive for a better more compassionate future All Americans want women and their babies to be safe loved and empowered no matter their situation or socioeconomic status I believe Americans are capable of seizing this moment and coming together to support those facing tremendous challenges and uncertainty We can support critical comprehensive services for women in need We can make it easier for working class families to earn money and raise children and we can support the rights and dignity of our youngest Americans This month I was elected to serve on the Ways and Means Committee and I intend to use this position to do better by American families We owe our most vulnerable children more effective policies that give them a better runway to achieve their dreams in a broken world I am engaging on Title IV B and IV E programs to ensure child welfare and foster care programs are as evidence based as MIECHV I am engaging on the Connecting Forever Families Act to expedite foster care placements and help child welfare courts adopt new procedures to address the unacceptable delays and backlogs for children waiting for placements in supportive homes I will fight for children in foster care who have to spend nights in shelters government offices or other inappropriate settings because of our congregate care crisis I am shedding light on the unfair audit rates of families who have claimed their adoption tax credit 70 percent of whom were audited in the most recent available data Children are obviously our future and we must work harder to ensure every child has the opportunity and resources to thrive and succeed
704	Mr Speaker this past Sunday on January 22 our Nation mourned the 50th anniversary of Roe v Wade the treacherous ruling that paved the way for the murder of more than 60 million innocent babies all precious all worth saving and all made in the perfect image of God Thankfully the victorious Dobbs ruling overturned Roe v Wade last year rightfully returning the issue of abortion back to the States However while we champion this momentous win in the fight for the unborn we cannot forget the millions of lives lost to the evils of abortion Today I introduced a resolution to recognize January 22 as the Day of Tears to honor and mourn the loss of these unborn children But in the face of President Biden s pro abortion agenda we must do more to defend the sanctity of human life May God raise up more warriors to protect innocent life because life after all is our first and foremost fundamental unalienable right Last week I proudly introduced with nearly 90 original cosponsors the Protect the UNBORN Act to block and defund President Biden s pro abortion executive orders Congress must take action to protect the unborn and prevent taxpayer dollars from funding the left s radical and destructive abortion agenda We must never downplay the evils of abortion As an unapologetic pro life advocate I am proud to defend the unborn and fight for the sanctity of life
705	Mr Speaker I yield to the gentleman from Colorado Mr Lamborn who is looking forward to reintroducing the Second Chance at Life Act which would require abortion facilities to provide information at least 24 hours in advance that explains that the chemical abortion process may be reversed before taking the second of the two drugs required
706	Mr Speaker I rise to remember the lives lost due to the Roe v Wade decision There are an estimated 64 million American souls who are missing as a result We gather today on this 50th anniversary solemnly but hopefully As Members of Congress we are tasked with representing our constituents even the unborn ones I will always speak out and fight to protect the sanctity of these lives It is difficult to imagine how we as a Nation allowed this decision to stand for almost 50 years I have hope and know that the Supreme Court has provided for us a brighter future with their decision in Dobbs Last Congress as was just stated I introduced the Second Chance at Life Act Chemical abortions can be reversed with no harm to the child if the pregnant mother develops second thoughts midway through the chemical abortion process My legislation again in this Congress will give the opportunity of life for thousands of unborn children So Mr Speaker I want to thank Representative Smith and Representative Fischbach for their leadership in the Congressional Pro Life Caucus and for holding this Special Order
707	Mr Speaker I really appreciate Chris Smith and I thank the gentlewoman from Minnesota Mrs Fischbach for having this Special Order Mr Speaker today as we mourn the millions of babies lost because of the decision in Roe v Wade 53 years ago we also celebrate the millions that will be saved now because that decision has been overturned Tragically Mr Speaker my Democratic colleagues would rather spread lies about the Supreme Court decision than to tell the truth They want to deceive you into believing that Republicans don t care about women s health that is crazy even as they enable and encourage biological men to use women s bathrooms and to compete in women s sports and they are content to simply watch pro abortion thugs attack and burn pregnancy centers and churches around the country They may refuse the truth because it doesn t further their anti life agenda but they can t change it The truth is that the reversal of Roe v Wade returned the power to where it belongs and that is to States So today I celebrate that decision I pray for those taken and I renew my promise to never surrender the fight for our unborn I will always defend the voiceless and I will always stand for life
708	Mr Speaker I thank Congresswoman Fischbach for yielding Mr Speaker 50 years ago the Supreme Court handed down a decision that will live in infamy Because of that opinion over 63 million unborn children have lost their lives due to abortion In time future generations will look back at this moment in American history and wonder how the greatest country in the world could have permitted modern day slaughter of the innocent Our Nation has dehumanized those who are seen as a burden Comfort and convenience are now the new cardinal virtues of our modern society It is this mentality and this historic decay of the value of life that has allowed our Nation to treat the unborn as a disposable commodity Over the last five decades we have treated the unborn as problems to be solved rather than children to be loved Due to the incredible work of millions of patriotic Americans abortion has been consigned to the ash heap of history On this day we thank those Americans who for over 50 years willingly and joyfully stood outside in the January cold for the March for Life On June 24 2022 the United States of America declared to the world that once again our Nation will embrace the intrinsic worth and value of every human life This is a reminder however that our work is not yet done We will continue to work and convince hearts and minds that the culture of life is worth preserving May all those who work to promote the cause of life forever know that their cause is true their cause is beautiful and their cause is good
709	Mr Speaker I thank the gentlewoman for yielding Mr Speaker I rise today to give a voice to the voiceless all across our country and to speak out against the culture of death that has been perpetuated by the abortion industry here in America Our Founding Fathers enshrined in the Declaration of Independence the unalienable rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness I thought it very telling that our Vice President was speaking on this very issue just the other day and she only mentioned two of those unalienable rights only two of them She left out life I think she left out life because that is where we are at now We talk about a culture of death and we don t talk about life Our Nation cannot sit idly by as 1 million unborn children have this life taken from them every year every year This is advancing the normalizing of this culture of death Mr Speaker I am grateful to stand before you now and celebrate the fact that this culture of death is turning The Supreme Court Dobbs decision doesn t end abortion in America but by placing abortion decisions at the State level where it belongs voters now have a greater voice in shaping our abortion laws But that doesn t stop our resolve at the Federal level Throughout my time in Congress I have fought to pass laws that respect life at every stage from conception to natural death and support both mothers and babies before and after birth Earlier this month I proudly joined with my colleagues in the House to pass H R 26 the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act which simply ensures that babies who survive failed abortions receive the same life saving care that all babies who live can receive It is amazing to think that we have to pass a law like this Last week I joined Congressman Alex Mooney to again introduce the Life and Conception Act which recognizes the humanity and life of the unborn and ensures they receive equal protection under the 14th Amendment Mr Speaker whether we take a child s life in the womb or we take it at First and Main that is simply geography Life is our most precious gift from God and it is our obligation to protect the most basic of rights for our next generation
710	Mr Speaker I thank the gentleman from Florida for his remarks He mentioned the culture of death but we are working and we are succeeding in turning back into the culture of life and changing hearts and minds Mr Speaker I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota Mr Stauber who is my great friend My colleague from Minnesota is a true champion of life
711	Mr Speaker I thank Representative Fischbach for allowing me to speak and for her leadership on this issue Mr Speaker I rise today to recognize the 50th anniversary of the Supreme Court s Roe v Wade decision Over the past five decades we have seen the devastation of this ruling which has led to the loss of tens of millions of innocent lives here in the United States I am heartened by the Supreme Court s reversal of this decision in Dobbs v Jackson last year and the countless lives that will now be saved each year For me and my family the sanctity of life is deeply personal Nearly 20 years ago my wife Jodi and I became parents of a baby born with Down syndrome Whenever I look at my son Isaac I see a miracle of God s special gift to our family Today Isaac is an incredible kind and charming young man and we know his future is bright Now imagine what kind of world we would be living in if every child was given the same chance to reach their potential The world would be much better and our collective future would be much brighter Since the start of the current Congress the House has voted on two bills to protect and support life I am proud that all of my Republican colleagues joined me in supporting these very important measures Unfortunately very few of my Democrat colleagues joined us in support To those Democrats who joined us in defending life I commend you for your courage to stand up to the radical wing of your party which pushes for abortion on demand without limits and paid for with taxpayer dollars The right to life should not be a partisan issue I extend an olive branch to all of my Democratic colleagues from across the aisle and encourage them to join us in our fight for life and to protect the most innocent among us the unborn It is up to us to do what is right and always defend life
712	Mr Speaker I thank the gentleman from Minnesota for sharing his personal story and that strong and true support for life Mr Speaker I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania Mr Kelly who introduced the Heartbeat Protection Act which would prohibit abortions when a fetal heartbeat is detected with the exceptions of rape incest and life of the mother when necessary
713	Mr Speaker I thank Representative Fischbach for hosting this Special Order tonight Mr Speaker it has been 7 months since the Supreme Court s landmark decision to overthrow Roe v Wade In that time we have seen incredible progress to protect life around this country including right here in Washington D C Just last week many tens of thousands of families came out to the annual March for Life to peacefully and prayerfully show their support for the unborn The week before that the new pro life Republican majority took major steps to protect the unborn We passed legislation to ensure babies who survive an abortion receive the healthcare they need and to condemn the attacks against pro life crisis pregnancy centers All of this is so important but it is only the first step Advocates and people of faith around the country are going to their State and Federal lawmakers and asking for change It is my hope that this Republican majority will continue to pass pro life legislation But my real question is Where is the outrage Nearly 1 million unborn children are expected to die in 2023 from abortion in the United States of America where protecting life is our highest calling where we are the first responder anywhere in the world anytime there is an attack on life anytime there is a tragedy and anytime there is a need for somebody to come there to try and save lives and yet in 2023 1 million of the unborn will be aborted It is incredible to me that in a nation that has been blessed for so long with so much can turn a blind eye and a deaf ear to the cries of the unborn My question is Where is the outrage of my fellow Americans Where is the cry against this injustice that is taking place Where are we standing not as a political party but as citizens of the world As I said earlier if there is a cry for help anywhere on this globe it is America that will be the first responder It is America that will be there to save lives It is America that will go to any end of the world to help and yet in our own country we are willing to turn a blind eye and a deaf ear to the abortion of over 1 million babies a year Where is the outrage
714	Mr Speaker I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania We are here to speak up for the unborn We hear their cry and we will continue to fight and hear the unborn Mr Speaker I yield to the gentleman from Mississippi Mr Guest who with the House Congressional Pro Life Caucus chair Chris Smith helped lead the amicus brief in support of Mississippi s Dobbs case The amicus brief was joined by more than 200 Members of Congress including myself and urged the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v Wade The Congressman from Mississippi was instrumental in that fight
715	Mr Speaker on July 4 1776 our Founding Fathers in the preamble to the Declaration of Independence wrote these words that form the very foundation of our great Nation We hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness Mr Speaker I stand before you today to say that we cannot and to say that we will not forget the duty of this Congress to defend the inalienable right to life We cannot forget the devastating impact that Roe v Wade caused on families and the unborn That devastation would have continued if Dobbs v Jackson a case that proudly originated in my home State of Mississippi had not come before the Supreme Court and opened the pathway to allow States to protect life If our great Nation can unite around any singular issue it should be that life is sacred that life is a gift from God and that life should be protected
716	Mr Speaker I come to you tonight as a lot of my colleagues are doing recognizing the 50 year anniversary of the very flawed decision of Roe v Wade Although the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade last year we cannot forget the lives that were lost during those almost 50 devastating years The lives lost during the Roe era must serve as a reminder of why we continue to fight for life I have said before and I will continue to say that I am pro life I am pro family and I am pro child In the wake of the Dobbs decision many States like my home State of Alabama have taken steps to protect the unborn However there is more work to be done when it comes to protecting the lives of the innocent Just last week the annual March for Life took place here in Washington D C as has already been mentioned Instead of marching on the Supreme Court thousands of pro life advocates marched on Congress They know our work isn t finished and they are calling on Congress to do our job to protect life I am proud to see that pro life measures have already passed the House with bipartisan support in this new Congress Also I look forward to continued bipartisan efforts to protect the most vulnerable among us and this should be Mr Speaker a bipartisan issue This anniversary serves as a solemn reminder of the tragic losses as a result of Roe v Wade but it also serves as a reminder that the fight for life is not over I also thank Mrs Fischbach for her leadership in organizing this hour to uphold the sanctity of human life
717	Mr Speaker as has been mentioned prior to 1973 there would be what I would consider a consensus in this country that it would be horrific to prematurely kill a child in the womb At the time as a practical matter there were only two or three States in which abortion was legal and there were times in this country before then in which every State considered abortion illegal We know what happened after Roe v Wade Over the next 50 years over 73 million lives were cut short people who would have had long lives and accomplished who knows how much You can imagine how America would have changed if those people had actually lived Recently Roe v Wade was overturned and there was a lot of elation because of that However since that time I think six States have had referendums While it was widely believed that abortion should be illegal in 1973 despite the fact that we had ultrasounds at that time despite the fact that again and again in workplaces we pass around pictures with the ultrasounds showing children at 3 4 or 5 months old American opinion was a disappointment Even in conservative States like Michigan Kansas Montana and Kentucky the public voted pro abortion What can we make of this Because we have had the ultrasound in between Roe v Wade and now we have to say that unfortunately the people who should have been educating the public have failed to do their duty The churches in the last 50 years allowed this shift of opinion to happen By the way it should have been easy to explain why abortion was horrific because of the huge increase in ultrasounds Instead we are joining a handful of countries Vietnam North Korea Red China out there saying abortion should be legal in some States through birth Is this how we repay our maker for this wonderful country that we have I call upon America to call upon the churches to educate the public on what is right and wrong that every one of these children is a gift from God and that it is time for America to wake up I do believe right now we have as with so many other issues a problem with the clergy in the country but I hope Americans can ask their clergymen where they are when these decisions are being made all around the country and where they are when these referendums are coming before the people We need more help from the mute clergy
718	Mr Speaker I thank the gentlewoman from Minnesota for her leadership with this incredibly important Special Order Mr Speaker I rise tonight during this Special Order to reaffirm my commitment to protect and defend the sanctity of life From the moment I stepped foot into this Chamber in 2009 I cemented my promise to protect our most vulnerable the unborn Our Founders enshrined in the Declaration of Independence three inalienable rights The first is the right to life Tonight we celebrate the right to life Last year the Supreme Court made it clear determining the right to an abortion is the responsibility of the State through the people and their elected officials Mr Speaker life matters Friday marked the first March for Life since the end of Roe v Wade Tens of thousands convened in Washington to celebrate the change from a national culture of death to one of life The evidence that life matters goes well beyond the Supreme Court however and the Supreme Court ruling that was finally delivered in 2022 shifting the defense of the innocent unborn to 50 State capitols Here is the evidence of why we should also celebrate in addition to that ruling In the United States there are 2 500 pregnancy resource centers that support unborn babies and their parents There are only 800 abortion clinics in this Nation That is an amazing shift in numbers Of the practicing OB GYN doctors 90 percent do not perform abortions God bless the pregnancy resource center staff that educate encourage and empower men and women to make informed life choices based on Christian principles and values their trained client advocates and medical personnel including registered nurses certified phlebotomy technicians and registered diagnostic medical sonographers Mr Speaker my position on life has always been clear You can t be a champion for the future of this great country if you are going to limit its potential It is my strong belief that every child every human life is sacred and has a purpose in this world
719	Mr Speaker I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his steadfast commitment to the unborn and strong support of the right to life Mr Speaker I thank all of my colleagues who spoke this evening for standing up to give a voice to the voiceless unborn children for standing up for life Our Conference will continue to be strong for mothers and their unborn children Mr Speaker I yield back the balance of my time
720	Mr Speaker I rise today to celebrate the historic achievements of Ron Klain one of the best chiefs of staff in modern American history Ron Klain helped craft the American Rescue Plan finally prioritizing working families and the middle class Ron Klain helped implement the President s vaccine plan that made Americans return to normal life He was key in a closely divided House and Senate to passing the CHIPS and Science Act He was key to the infrastructure bill to help the House caucus come together progressives and moderates and Republicans Ron Klain succeeded because he had personal relationships with so many Members I believe when history is written he will be regarded as one of the best chiefs of staff
721	Now Mr President just a few moments before you assumed the Chair Senator Murray opened the Senate as President pro tempore for the first time Kudos congratulations She is a great great Member She is the chair of Appropriations and now PPT and it was a wonderful thing to see her open up the Senate for the first time as PPT So congratulations to Senator Murray and to all of us for having such a good President pro tempore
722	Mr President now on to business in no time at all the House Republicans are off to the rockiest start of any new majority in recent memory Have you ever seen anything like this We aren t even a month into the new Congress and already the House GOP has shown the American people they have been consumed by chaos paralyzed by division and held captive by the most extreme elements of their conference On their first day of voting the very first day House Republicans decided their first order of business as the new majority was to pass legislation making it easier for ultrarich tax cheats to escape accountability Amazing That is their first thing At the same time as they did that they would blow a hole a 100 billion hole in the deficit because according to CBO the amount of money brought into the Federal Treasury by closing some of these loopholes against tax cheats very wealthy tax cheats would far exceed the expenditure made for the new IRS agents The deficit would come down if we passed this legislation For all the talk on the other side about we have got to bring down the deficit not when it comes to closing loopholes of the ultrarich and corporations that pay a smaller percentage than most Americans uh uh Wow Apparently cutting taxes for megacorporations and the 1 percent was not enough for Republicans 5 years ago They did that in the Trump tax bill Now they want to make things even easier for tax cheats Then a few days later the House Republicans doubled down on their war on women by passing measures that will undermine women s freedom of choice Make no mistake these bills will never see the light of day in the Senate But again the extreme the extreme MAGA fringe element of the Republican Party seems to be controlling the whole entity We hope that doesn t last for long We in the Senate will serve as an inextinguishable firewall and stop the anti woman anti health anti choice bills in their tracks So right off the bat the House Republicans are showing us exactly whose corner they are in the ultrarich and the fringe elements of their party Now make no mistake Democrats want to work with a competent and capable Republican Party wherever possible to make life better for average Americans Democrats are united in this commitment because we all saw firsthand how bipartisanship was the key to so many of last year s successes Later today in fact I will join President Biden Leader Jeffries and a number of Senate and House colleagues precisely to talk about how we can turn our unity into action to help the American people House Republicans meanwhile seem trapped in a cycle of extremism so powerful that now they are even giving proposals like a national sales tax a national sales tax serious consideration According to some House Republicans House leadership has agreed to give GOP radicals a vote on a 30 percent national sales tax on all goods across the board That means right now with inflation finally beginning to drop Republicans are looking to make Americans pay 30 percent more for everything they buy Look if Republicans want to have a debate with Democrats on their national sales tax bill we will be happy to have it We would love to hear Republicans explain to the American people why it is a good idea to send prices skyrocketing on everything from cars to groceries to diapers and everything in between We would love to hear Republicans tell seniors why their expenses would go up by a third after they have spent a lifetime for retirement And we would love to hear Republicans explain to middle class families why their taxes would increase by thousands of dollars a year while the ultrarich see their taxes go down If Republicans want to push this terrible proposal they are welcome to make their case Make our day I think many within the Republicans own ranks recognize that a national sales tax is an especially dimwitted idea Even Grover Norquist whose ideas on tax are far away from most Americans and he is one of the most conservative voices out there called it a terrible idea Even Steve Forbes said this would make the average new home in this country cost 100 000 more Young families do you want to buy a home Some of our Republican friends want to add 100 000 to the cost of buying that home and of course it would raise bills by thousands more And yet yet despite the insanity of this idea the House Republican leadership is bent to the MAGA wing of the Republican Party and have promised a vote If this is how House Republicans want to spend their time taxing middle class families attacking women s freedom of choice giving cover to tax cheats be our guest Once again this is the central quandary of the new Republican majority By bending to the demands of the MAGA hard right Speaker McCarthy has guaranteed that Republicans will have to constantly cater to the whims of the MAGA wing at the expense of the American people Now we will be a firewall against all of these things and I am sure the American people are glad that we have a Democratic majority in the Senate to stop some of these rather insane proposals because when extremists run the show as seems to be happening in the House it makes it nearly impossible to have serious minded constructive conversations on the big issues that matter No issue of course will matter more in the coming months than raising the debt ceiling Over the next few months we are going to hear more about the debt ceiling in Congress maybe more than any other issue But the matter is very simple If the United States is allowed to default on its debt for the first time the consequences will be severe and every single American will pay the price A default means interest rates will spike on everything from car loans to credit cards to mortgages It means that Americans will have to pay thousands of dollars more on regular expenses Homes will lose their value Homes the average middle class person s piece of the rock that they struggled and saved for so that they could own a home and so they don t have to pay rent and can pay a mortgage where they get equity those homes will lose their value if we default God forbid on the debt because mortgage interest rates will soar That means people will have less money to pay for a home and supply and demand just sits The price goes down The value goes down Meanwhile the millions of Americans who have saved for retirement will see their retirement plans like 401 k s lose their value robbing retirees of their hard earned livelihoods So the dangers of default are not abstract Oh no this is not some academic argument up there in the clouds This affects every American family and we are going to make sure that they hear all about it The consequences are as real as they get and the entire world is watching what we do here in Congress But rather than work with Democrats in a productive constructive way to raise the debt ceiling the House GOP has immediately resorted to brinksmanship and hostage taking They say they will not raise the debt ceiling unless we give in to their demands for draconian spending cuts that would impact just about every American again in a very bad way Well I say to my Republican colleagues if you want to talk about deep cuts then you have an obligation an obligation to show the American people precisely what kind of cuts you are talking about Are Republicans going to hold Social Security hostage in exchange for the debt ceiling or pay raises for our troops or support for veterans or funding for police and fire and first responders or Medicare funding that millions of seniors rely on Republicans you owe the American people answers on what you mean by spending cuts Remember the House rules that the GOP approved are clear They need to bring a debt ceiling bill to the floor let the entirety of the House debate it and vote on it and let the American people see and assess the cuts for themselves So once again to my House GOP colleagues if you are serious about spending cuts show us the math Show us why you think it is worth risking a global financial crisis just to pass an extremist agenda because inevitably what you are saying are cuts are vital to so many Americans so many Americans Being in the majority means that it won t be enough to hide behind time worn rhetoric about wasteful spending When it comes to the debt ceiling the substance counts the details count and the consequences are very very real Unless the Republicans can resolve their own chaos and beat back their own extremism I fear that every day that passes without action on the debt ceiling will increase the risk of default and risk the great harm it will do to the American people And should that happen Americans will see that the fault lies entirely in the hands of the radical GOP I yield the floor I suggest the absence of a quorum
723	Mr President the Biden administration has spent 2 years turning its back on the proven tools and policies that Republicans used to strengthen our southern border 2 years of a functionally open borders policy from Washington Democrats and 2 years of chaos and suffering as a result Last week Customs and Border Protection announced that an already recordbreaking year ended on a particularly catastrophic note Illegal immigration apprehensions clocked an alltime high of more than 2 7 million during the last fiscal year by far the highest annual total ever recorded But then December set an astonishing record all by itself at over 250 000 apprehensions Last month was CBP s busiest month ever recorded The American people are outraged at this willful failure They rate immigration and the border as one of the single biggest problems facing our country second only to the economy Two thirds two thirds of the country disapprove of President Biden s handling of immigration and the border That is a 67 percent supermajority of Americans who believe this administration is failing on border security Our Democratic friends tie themselves in knots making excuses for why they can t simply do their job enforce Federal law and secure our border Their far left base makes them pretend that we can t enforce the laws on the books unless unless we find new ways to be even more generous to people who come here illegally It is nonsensical Even local officials who belong to the Democratic Party are rapidly losing patience with the Biden administration s border incompetence The Democratic mayor of New York Eric Adams has spent months sounding the alarm on the catastrophic effects of this administration s functionally open borders He said This is a national crisis He said There is no more room in New York Yet the far left attacks him the mayor of New York for pointing out the problem The Democratic Governor of Colorado is taking a cue from Governor Abbott and Governor DeSantis and arranging transportation for illegal immigrants to various liberal jurisdictions that have self identified as so called sanctuary cities There is a growing bipartisan chorus that is begging begging President Biden to do his job and secure our Nation It doesn t take new laws It doesn t take some new grand bargain or amnesty The administration just needs to do its job Secure the border and let law enforcement enforce our laws The Biden administration has all the tools and authorities it needs to tackle this crisis if a solution were actually what they were after
724	Mr President on Friday as they have done for decades Americans from around the country many of them young people took to the streets of Washington DC to march for life This year of course was a little different because for the first time since the march began nearly 50 years ago pro lifers marched in a post Roe America On June 24 2022 the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade and recognized that the Constitution does not contain a right to abortion that our founding document does not confer a right to deprive one group of citizens of their right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness simply because they are small and defenseless The Supreme Court s decision marked the righting of a constitutional wrong and it opened up the chance to right a great moral wrong the legalized killing of unborn Americans The Dobbs decision overturning Roe v Wade does not of course make abortion illegal but it does allow State governments and the Federal Government to finally begin to establish meaningful protections for unborn children The Dobbs decision marked a major victory for the pro life movement and for the babies whose lives are in jeopardy from abortion but the Dobbs decision does not mark an end to the pro life movement or the March for Life but a new beginning The legal fight turns from the courts to Congress and State legislatures in other words to the democratic process where this issue belongs and has always belonged and the work to change hearts and minds to support moms and babies continues The Dobbs decision may have opened the door to meaningful legal protections for unborn Americans but abortion extremists who unfortunately count the majority of the Democratic Party among their ranks are doing everything they can to stand in the way of these protections To give just one example of how far the abortion on demand caucus has taken things 2 weeks ago the House of Representatives took up legislation to ensure that babies who survive abortions and are born alive are guaranteed medical care Almost every single Democrat in the House of Representatives voted against the legislation That is 210 men and women who apparently think that living babies who have already been born already been born can legitimately be left to die or I suppose be killed outright by the abortionist That is a horrifying position There is much work to be done to get to a day when a country that is supposed to be dedicated to the protection of life and liberty actually guarantees the right to life of all Americans including the most vulnerable and most innocent Americans our unborn children So the March for Life today is more important than ever The march of course is just one small facet of the pro life movement which works every day in every State around the country to help provide help and hope to moms in need but it is nevertheless a vitally important facet because the March for Life provides a public witness to the humanity of the unborn child and to the great injustice that is happening behind closed doors Abortion happens away from public view so it can be all too easy to forget that every year in this country hundreds of thousands of babies are being killed by abortion The Guttmacher Institute a pro abortion research organization reported that there were more than 900 000 abortions in 2020 900 000 To put that number in perspective 900 000 is roughly equivalent to the entire population of the State of South Dakota the entire population of South Dakota That is a lot of lives lost a lot of love lost Our society is a poorer place without those babies and the March for Life reminds us of that It reminds us that every day thousands of babies lose their lives to abortion It reminds us of our responsibility to confront this injustice and to work for a day when every child enjoys the right to life and the full protection of the laws I am profoundly grateful for all those who spent last Friday marching for life and for all the men and women and young people in the pro life movement who work every day around this country to help mothers and their babies and secure legal protections for unborn Americans I know there are many days when it feels like an uphill battle but you are all on the right side of history And I am confident that in the end life will prevail In the Gospel of Matthew Jesus says See that you do not despise one of these little ones For I tell you that their angels in Heaven always see the face of my Father And again Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these There is no greater work than standing up for these defenseless little ones I pray that God will bless the efforts of all those marching for life and one day soon every child born and unborn will enjoy the full protection of our laws I yield the floor I suggest the absence of a quorum
725	Mr President now on another matter it has been a full year since Putin escalated Russia s brutal war against Ukraine and nearly 9 years since he began his military effort to take over the sovereign country in early 2014 Putin s nonmilitary efforts to meddle in Ukraine undermine it and control its population long predated even 2014 It has been 15 years since Putin invaded Georgia A few years before that he said publicly the breakup of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century The former KGB agent who has run the Kremlin for two decades has been very very consistent repression at home aggression abroad assassinations invasions poisonings and political interference And whenever the rest of the world responded with accommodation rather than with resolve Putin drew the natural conclusion that he could do whatever he wanted But for the past 11 months the brave men and women in Ukraine have defied the odds They have endured tremendous hardship and stood their ground They have fought bravely for their families their freedom and their country At every step of the way investments from the United States and our allies have equipped the Ukrainian people to exact a heavy price from the Russian invaders Western assistance has played a key role but it has come too slowly and haltingly Despite my urging the Biden administration to act sooner aid did not come early enough to help Ukraine deter Putin s escalation before it actually happened nor to slow down Russia s brutal and rapid advance in the east and the south It has not come quickly enough to help Ukraine sustain counteroffensives or fully defend its cities against missile and drone attacks The United States and our friends and our partners have done enough to prevent Ukraine from losing from losing but we have not yet done enough to help Ukraine actually win A protracted stalemate is neither in Ukraine s interest nor ours The solution that is both the most humane and the most advantageous to America s interests is quite simple Help Ukraine win this war We know what it will take to make this possible As our colleague Senator Wicker said We can shift this war immediately in Ukraine s favor by providing a range of advanced weapons including tanks drones and tactical missiles And as Chairman McCaul from the House said this past weekend it is not the United States that will be provocative if we send stronger assistance Mr Putin is the provocative one He invaded a sovereign territory aggressively and unprovoked Yet some of freedom s most powerful friends remain hesitant For many months Germany has not only resisted calls to send Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine but has actually also prevented other European nations from transferring their own German produced Leopards to Ukraine Time is short and while Berlin agonizes over its own decision whether to provide Leopards to Ukraine it should proactively and explicitly make clear that other allies are free to do so What about the Biden administration here at home The administration s latest deliveries failed to include failed to include the longer range missiles and more sophisticated munitions that Ukraine has been requesting literally for months for months Ukraine s brave resistance deserves our continued praise but more importantly it needs our concrete and consistent materiel support Ukraine s strengths cannot keep self deterring ourselves and letting the aggressors the invaders dictate the pace So it is time past time for the Biden administration and our allies to get serious about helping Ukraine finish the job and retake their country I suggest the absence of a quorum
726	Mr President we have seen this movie before The Senate finds itself in familiar territory The United States narrowly avoided hitting the debt ceiling over a year ago but now we are staring down the barrel of another debt crisis The United States hit the debt limit last Thursday according to the Secretary of Treasury and now the Treasury is using what they refer to euphemistically as extraordinary measures in order to prevent the government from defaulting on its debts Unless the Congress takes action in the coming months the American economy will be confronted with an unprecedented crisis But here is what I find strange Despite the fact that we are hurtling toward this disaster the White House seems completely disinterested in finding a solution President Biden has drawn a redline He said We are not going to negotiate on the debt ceiling In other words he expects Congress to raise the debt ceiling with no conditions attached and let this reckless runaway spending and outrageous debt continue to rise Now I don t want to disparage drunken sailors but it seems to me that that is the model for how the White House is responding It is as if you or I were spending beyond our means on our credit card and then the issuer of the credit card said You know you are going to have to pay the money back at some point And you say To heck with that I want you to raise my credit limit even higher without any demonstrated means or plan to actually pay the money back We know what would happen for you and me is the issuer of the credit card would cancel our credit card as well it should if we responded the way that the White House is responding So apparently what the administration plans to continue to do is continue this spending bender It can t cover the current bills now it is roughly 30 trillion and it expects somebody anybody maybe nobody to pay the money back and to deal with this ever growing national debt We know this is an even bigger problem in inflationary times because the more money the Federal Government continues to spend it is like throwing gasoline on inflation and consumers have already experienced sky high prices some of the highest prices in 40 years on everything from gasoline to food to housing and to the essentials of life So why in the world does it make sense for the administration to say We are not even going to talk we are not even going to negotiate with the House when it comes to the debt ceiling We are just going to keep spending as much money as we can racking up more and more debt I know that President Biden has children and grandchildren Is he concerned for their welfare We are writing checks that we are not going to have to pay back Mr President You and I are at the age where this bird is not going to come home to roost in our lifetime but it will in the lifetimes of our children and grandchildren including those of President Biden So how responsible or I should say how irresponsible is it for the President to say We are just going to keep on keeping on and we are not even going to talk about what we need to do to deal with this mounting debt We are not even going to entertain any reasonable ideas or suggestions about how we dig our way out of this hole Well the American people witnessed our Democratic colleagues wasteful spending over the last 2 years and chose a new direction in the midterm elections that gave Republicans the House after 2 years in which our Democratic colleagues spent 1 9 trillion on the so called American Rescue Plan and then another 700 or so billion dollars on the so called Inflation Reduction Act which by the way doesn t reduce inflation but that is what it is called In response the voters gave Republicans the majority in the House I can only imagine that part of that was a response to what they saw as a reckless spending binge that was going to continue without end if they maintained Democratic control of both Houses and the White House So the new reality of divided government means there is only one path we can take to avoiding a debt bomb Republicans and Democrats have to reach a compromise I know the Presiding Officer believes that part of our responsibility is to negotiate and try to come up with common ground where we can and not simply to give the Heisman to one another and say we are not even going to talk I don t know why we are here as Members of Congress or why you would want to be President of the United States when you would see such a big problem growing bigger by the day and say Forget it I am not talking I am not going to try to solve the problem That is somebody else s issue that is not ours I don t believe that is a responsible reaction and I don t think most Members of Congress think it is a responsible reaction but that is where we are today but it needs to change As we know the reality of Republican control of the House means that the negotiation on the debt ceiling and there has to be a negotiation in reality has to be between the House and the White House Nothing we do here that would get 60 votes would pass the House I believe I think that is pretty clear But in order to avoid a catastrophe a bill not only has to pass the House it needs to get 60 votes in the Senate and the President s signature Those are the facts Now drawing unreasonable lines in the sand and issuing ultimatums do nothing to solve the problem Instead of doling out marching orders the President needs to do his job and listen to what is being proposed and to negotiate a solution Nobody I know of thinks that breaching the debt ceiling is an acceptable outcome If that is true and I believe it is true then there is only one alternative try to work together to come up with some negotiated outcome that avoids breaching the debt ceiling but at the same time provides some answer to those people concerned and I am one of them about the ever increasing debt and what high interest rates that are used to combat inflation are going to mean in terms of how much money we are going to have to pay to service that debt and where that will come out of things like defense spending or other priorities President Biden served as a Member of the Senate for many many years and he ran on the promise of continuing his same approach as a dealmaker as President of the United States In fact he pointed to his record in the Senate and as Vice President as proof of his ability to reach across the aisle and to strike a compromise Now I know in some quarters compromise is a dirty word these days but there is no other way for us to function here because none of us is a dictator none of us can say This is the way it is and actually be able to accomplish what they seek Instead the President does have some record a good record in one instance of doing exactly what he refuses to do today As Vice President Joe Biden helped negotiate the 2011 Budget Control Act which was the last substantial and meaningful attempt to rein in wasteful Washington spending At that point our economy was still recovering from a recession caused by the financial crisis in 2008 Federal spending soared revenues plummeted and it was clear that something something had to be done to stave off an even bigger economic crisis President Obama was in the White House and Congress was divided Democrats controlled the Senate Republicans controlled the House in 2011 And as it turns out then Vice President Biden was a key negotiator He helped broker the agreement working principally with then Senator McConnell the Republican leader to come up with a bill that passed with strong bipartisan support So here we are a dozen years later and we find ourselves in a similar condition without the solution Our economy is recovering from an unprecedented pandemic Federal spending has soared A large part of that was roughly 5 trillion that Democrats and Republicans spent together because we saw no alternative but to try to respond to the COVID crisis in a way that addressed public health needs like coming up with a vaccine and helped sustain our economy during this crisis But then the wheels came off the bipartisanship over the last 2 years as I mentioned with the ARP and the IRA to use a couple of acronyms But the American people have nowhere else to turn but here for to us address this problem Now I think it is easy to engage in the blame game and we do it here all the time In fact here in Washington DC it is a world class sport but at some point you have got to quit pointing the finger and you have got to try to step up and roll up your sleeves and try to solve the immediate problem I am not suggesting we can solve all of our problems or even do it permanently but we can address this current crisis by doing what we are paid to do what we are elected to do what we took an oath to do which is to represent our constituents to the best of our ability So this is the time for President Biden to step up He is President of the United States and he has done it before when he was Vice President in 2011 All it would take to start this process is to invite the House the Senate Come Sit around the table to discuss the problem and to try to listen to what potential solutions there might be just as he promised to do on the campaign trail So it is time for him to do what he promised to do all along and lead Presidents can t be a spectator They can t sit on the sidelines Nobody in America expects a President of the United States to do that And the fact is the President is not just a leader of the Democratic Party He is the elected leader of the United States of America all 330 plus million of us So taking a partisan position knowing the challenges that the House is going to have dealing with a debt ceiling and just sort of enjoying watching them struggle to deal with this is not an act of courage It is not an act of leadership We expect our Presidents to make tough decisions just as we ourselves are expected to make tough decisions and to try to come up with solutions I can t imagine any responsible person in the country much less in Congress who would take the position that a clean debt ceiling increase is the way to go I mentioned that a moment ago Who is going to pay the 30 trillion back we already owe Is the idea that we can just continue to heap debt upon debt upon debt Does anybody think that is a good idea How if we have another fiscal crisis like we had in 2008 would we be able to respond How if we had another pandemic would we be able to respond with this debt handcuffing Congress when we need maximum flexibility to be able to respond And I mentioned the interest rates that are higher than they have been in a long time which continue to eat up more and more tax revenue just to service that debt to pay their bondholders on their investment So this is not just a problem that can be punted This does not call for partisan responses This calls for statesmanship It calls for leadership And as part of this we have to look at what got us in this condition in the first place Why it is that we need to raise the debt ceiling We know that America s debt crisis didn t appear overnight It has been building for decades And lest anybody believe that I am suggesting that this is strictly a Democratic problem it has really been something that both political parties have contributed to over time Somehow we became anaesthetized or desensitized to the fact that we continue to spend borrowed money It is true that we point to the various crises we have had and we say Well we really didn t have any other choice But now we do have a choice We can respond to this responsibly and do our jobs Well we need to get out of control spending habits in check No household no city council no county government no State government could possibly do what the Federal Government is doing They have to live with a balanced budget They have to live within their means I am not suggesting it is going to be easy because it is not but it is not optional One of the most important things we can do as part of this response is to return to a regular appropriations process in funding the government each year The idea that we can do this through an omnibus appropriations process like we were forced to do last year in backing it up to December 23rd right before Christmas and threatening a shutdown is not the right way to do business The House and Senate Appropriations Committees have 12 separate bills to fund each of the different components of the Federal Government These bills are supposed to pass both Chambers and be signed into law before the end of the fiscal year which is September 30 That didn t happen in 2022 or 2021 The Democratic led Senate did not pass a single appropriations bill and I understand why The majority leader Senator Schumer and Speaker Pelosi realized that delaying the appropriations process and not going through this regular order gave them immense power because they could decide what went into that omnibus bill They could say yes to some and no to others and they knew that the only alternative would be a government shutdown and that rank and file Members of the Senate and the House would be left with no other choice than to vote yes or no Congress cannot continue to operate like this We have to swear off this newfound habit of continuing resolutions and last minute omnibuses and return to a regular on time appropriations process It is more transparent It allows every Member of the Congress to participate to offer amendments to debate and to vote something denied to rank and file Members of Congress when you do this through an omnibus bill at the end of the year But we shouldn t stop there We need to look at broader reforms to the government s spending habits The good news is that there are a number of ideas that have been proposed Last Congress Senator Romney the Senator from Utah introduced something he calls the TRUST Act which creates a process to save Social Security and protect this critical lifeline for Americans Social Security you might recall is going to become insolvent in the coming years This is a responsible way to save Social Security and to address what is roughly a part of the two thirds of the Federal spending In other words about a third of it is discretionary spending we appropriate and the other two thirds is mandatory or automatic spending I am a proud cosponsor of this legislation and would encourage the President and our Democratic colleagues to consider it as part of the debt ceiling discussion I am also a supporter of a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution As I said Republicans and Democrats are responsible for where we are today but it would finally make clear that we have to live under the same sort of spending limits that every family in America has to live under and that every local and State government has to live with a balanced budget Now that is common sense Families and businesses across the country have no choice but to operate within a balanced budget My State of Texas has a balanced budget requirement and lo and behold it just started the current legislative session with a 33 billion surplus We are looking at a 30 trillion debt My State has a 33 billion surplus in part I believe because it is required by law to balance its budget each year I have introduced cosponsored and voted for balanced budget amendments in the past and I plan on doing so again this year That should be part of the conversation There is a wide range of ideas from our colleagues that would help the Federal Government get its financial house in order and I would hope that the President would take these ideas and his responsibility seriously No matter how inconvenient this may be for President Biden we are operating under a divided government The drunken sailor approach may have worked when the Democrats controlled both Houses of Congress but it won t succeed now It is time for the administration to sober up and get serious about bipartisan solutions It is the only path out of this mess I yield the floor I suggest the absence of a quorum
727	Mr President 50 years ago this last Sunday the Supreme Court ruled that reproductive healthcare in America is a constitutionally protected right and that Americans have the freedom to make the most personal decision imaginable when and whether to start a family The case was called Roe v Wade For those who were alive when it was decided we remember what it meant for millions of Americans the freedom to make their own reproductive health decisions Remember at the time Roe was decided in 1973 our Nation had a long long way to go in living up to the promise of equal justice under the law As just one example women were often required at that time in history to ask their husbands for permission to apply for credit cards In many banks widowers and divorced women had to bring along a man who would cosign for a credit card Can you imagine that Fifty years later we still have a long way to go of course but Roe was a breakthrough It was a vision of an America that could be looking to the future of opportunity Well today sadly marks a very different anniversary You see it was 7 months ago today when six rightwing judicial activists on the Supreme Court sent us back in time Of course I am referring to the Supreme Court s decision in Dobbs v Jackson Women s Health Organization the crowning achievement of the Republican led decades long campaign to overturn Roe and abolish reproductive rights in America The Dobbs ruling is one of the most irresponsible and dangerous decisions ever handed down by the U S Supreme Court It ripped away a constitutional right from individuals handing it over to politicians in suits With the Dobbs decision the ultraconservative majority not only overturned a nearly 50 year old precedent that had been reaffirmed many many times they twisted the facts to reach the outcome they wanted What do I mean by that Well in his majority opinion Justice Alito claimed that abortion cannot be constitutionally protected because it is not deeply rooted in the Nation s history and tradition He is wrong because whatever you think about abortion it has deep roots in our country As the dissenting Justices in Dobbs wrote embarrassingly for the majority early law in fact does provide some support for abortion rights The dissent noted that common law authorities did not treat abortion as a crime before the point of fetal movement in the womb also known as quickening And as Justice Alito himself conceded historians dispute whether prequickening abortions were punished before the 19th century So there is no credibility to Justice Alito s argument for overturning Roe It wasn t originalism by any stretch It wasn t textualism It was an ideologically motivated outcome based on historical cherry picking Someone asked the question the other day After this decision should the Justices be asked to wear red and blue robes instead of black robes Over the past 7 months Republican lawmakers picked up right where the Thomas Alito Court left off In State after State they have ripped away reproductive rights from millions of Americans Overturning Roe v Wade has unleashed a healthcare crisis in our country In just 7 months 24 States have banned or severely restricted access to abortion or are preparing to do so Many of these bans provide no exceptions even for rape and incest victims and many are insufficient in protecting the health and lives of mothers And all of these bans have added layers and layers of government bureaucracy for women seeking emergency care If these Republican lawmakers have actually listened to all of the medical professionals who sounded the alarm on overturning Roe if these lawmakers had actually listened to all of the Americans who took to the streets in protest or the millions of voters who rejected their radical agenda then maybe you would understand the simple indisputable truth You cannot ban abortion out of existence The only thing these laws have changed if anything is pushing women into dangerous and deadly situations We have already seen the barbaric consequences in these Republican abortion bans And they haven t just endangered the lives of women living in red States they have put every woman in danger Christina Zielke is one of those women She recently shared her story on NPR This past July Christina and her husband were overjoyed when they discovered she was pregnant It was their first pregnancy But that joy turned to sorrow after the first ultrasound The doctors couldn t detect a heartbeat and they concluded it was a miscarriage When Christina asked the doctor What do I do next the doctor recommended giving her body time to pass the pregnancy tissue a process that can take days or even weeks So Christina and her husband decided to wait and move on with their lives Soon after that appointment the two of them drove from their home in Washington DC to Ohio to attend a family wedding But during the drive Christina started bleeding She assumed her body had finally passed the pregnancy tissue But later in the middle of the night she started bleeding again It was serious It was at that time that Christina and her husband at the advice of a nurse went to an emergency room in Painesville OH Now remember Christina s doctor had already told her that her pregnancy ended in a miscarriage But when she arrived at that Ohio hospital the medical staff refused to provide her any care because they were afraid of violating Ohio s new abortion ban So while Christina was still in danger still bleeding and carrying a fetus with no heartbeat the hospital discharged her and refused to treat her She objected even showing them her records confirming the miscarriage She was ignored and sent home Hours later she returned to that same ER By that point she had lost so much blood she had lost consciousness The paramedics had to use a sheet to pull her limp body out of a bathtub and onto a stretcher Christina s family thought she was going to die And let s be blunt The only reason her life was in peril was because of Ohio s State law banning abortion This is America s post Roe reality women denied urgent care because doctors and nurses are afraid of breaking State laws Ohio s abortion ban subjects healthcare providers who violate it to felony charges up to a year in prison loss of medical licenses and fines up to 20 000 The law is so unclear in Ohio that even medical professionals struggle to navigate its narrow exceptions When you hear stories like that by Christina imagine if it was a member of your family your wife the mother of your children people who want to live desperately and simply need the healthcare to make it happen it is really no surprise that Americans are fleeing red States to access essential healthcare in blue States My State of Illinois for instance has become a leader on reproductive freedom a so called oasis Every single State that we border has either restricted abortion or abandoned it outright For women living in the Midwest our reproductive health facilities are indispensable Look at the numbers Before Roe was overturned only 6 percent of women seeking abortions at Illinois Planned Parenthood facilities traveled from out of State 6 percent Since the Dobbs decision that number has jumped to 30 percent And I want to commend our State s leadership because they stepped in to provide care for women who have been betrayed by their own States Earlier this month Governor Pritzker signed a bill into law protecting women traveling to Illinois for reproductive care Sadly these efforts to protect reproductive freedom have also made Illinois providers a target Just 2 days ago after Governor Pritzker signed a bill into law someone firebombed a Planned Parenthood clinic in Peoria a clinic that doesn t even perform surgical abortions In post Roe America the mere act of seeking reproductive advice and care even for a procedure as simple as a Pap smear has taken on new risks Lawmakers on both sides need to condemn this and any form of politically motivated violence against any person or entity If there is any doubt that the Dobbs decision has unleashed chaos consider the impact on maternal health outcomes Even before Roe was overturned our Nation had the highest maternal mortality rate in the developed world America the highest maternal mortality rate in the developed world And as of 2020 those death rates are more than 60 percent higher in States with abortion restrictions This is not a problem without a solution Studies show that more than four in five pregnancy related deaths are preventable These mothers can be saved And one way to prevent them is by expanding access to postpartum health coverage That is why I have worked with Illinois Congresswoman Robin Kelly to pass a law that gives States the option to expand health coverage under Medicaid from 60 days postpartum to a full year We led this effort because in our State one third of pregnancy related deaths happen after 60 days postpartum So for States that have now outlawed abortion you would imagine the first thing they would do is to take advantage of this new benefit and expand health coverage for its expecting mothers on Medicaid That sounds like a no brainer right Apparently not Today there are 15 States that have not extended Medicaid postpartum coverage and 12 of these States have also passed laws restricting abortion If they are truly dedicated to the new mother and her baby why wouldn t they give them healthcare coverage for a full year after the baby is born to save their lives and the babies lives So if you are a woman living in a State like Idaho or South Dakota you can be forced to carry a pregnancy to term but once you have had your baby those States Idaho and South Dakota refuse to cover your healthcare during the most critical dangerous postpartum period Let s get real There is no world in which this position can be described as pro life We in the Senate can make a difference for all the women in America who have been abandoned by their States and we can do it by restoring and codifying the right to reproductive freedom by passing pro family policies like the MOMMA s Act which mandates Medicaid expansion and postpartum coverage Unfortunately it seems the new MAGA majority in the House has other plans in mind Just this past week Majority Leader Steve Scalise pledged to a group of anti choice activists that the overturning of Roe was only the first phase of this battle Those are his words His Republican colleagues have already made good on it Less than 1 month into the new Congress House Republicans have introduced a dozen anti abortion bills Here is my promise Every one of those bills is destined to fail if it comes to the Senate They are going nowhere because this majority and President Biden understand that all Americans deserve reproductive rights And until we have a Congress and Supreme Court willing to protect those rights we need to do everything in our power to stand against this extremist anti choice agenda I yield the floor
728	Mr President we are in a historic season as a country We are pausing to ask ourselves a question that quite frankly we have not really asked ourselves in a long time When does life begin It is not just philosophical It is not just theological It is not just scientific It is personal as each person has to come to a decision When does life begin And when the Supreme Court made the Dobbs decision last summer that actually put America back in the position that it had been in historically Our Nation is 234 years old and for 185 of those years each State passed State laws to be able to determine the decision about this issue of when does life begin So the Dobbs decision was not a radical decision It is the typical decision for Americans quite frankly for 185 of our 234 years But it doesn t settle the issue of abortion Abortion is still legal in America As much as there is all the noise around the country right now that abortion has somehow gone away it certainly has not Abortion is still all over the country But it has pushed Americans and it has pushed Americans specifically on this one issue When does life begin Quite frankly I have had fascinating conversations with people over the past 8 months that they had never actually contemplated this issue that they had never stopped to be able to think about it They just said Abortion is legal Abortion is legal It is just a woman s choice a woman s choice a woman s choice and I don t want to think about it But when the decision came down a lot of people had to stop and say When does life begin Is it at birth Is it after birth Is it 10 minutes before birth Is it a month before birth Is it 2 months before birth Quite frankly I have had this conversation with a lot of folks and some folks have told me Well it is at viability And I say OK Define viability for me because viability in 1973 when the Court was struggling with Roe v Wade was very different than viability now Medical science has advanced tremendously So is viability 26 weeks or is it at 21 weeks of gestation And if it is at 21 weeks what is the difference between 20 weeks and 19 weeks What is the difference between 18 weeks I look at these two pictures right here of this child this one is out of the womb and this one is 5 months earlier and I ask the simple question What is the difference between these two pictures of this child The only difference between that sonogram picture in the womb and that child outside of the womb is time That is it The same DNA is in this child as in this child the same parents the same development Everything is the same The only difference is time I am 5 months older than I was 5 months ago because I have aged 5 months So did that child from that moment So my question is very simple When is a child a child When does life begin Is this one not alive and this one is alive simply because he is 5 months older When is a child a child For 50 years there have been a group of folks this year there were tens of thousands who gather out on the Mall just to be able to celebrate every single child They have done it now for five decades since the Roe v Wade decision came down They have gathered on the Mall and they just said We believe every child is valuable every child There aren t some children who are disposable and some children who are valuable We think every child is valuable Now that is not a radical concept I have folks who yell and scream at me quite frankly and say A woman has the right to be able to choose And I ask just the very simple question of them in great respect Has the right to choose to be able to take the life of a child at what age Because that child is valuable and so is that child because it is the same child just at a different age I celebrate the folks who have for five decades gathered on The Mall and have marched for life and have said We will not forget the value of every single child because tens of millions of children have died in this country in the last 50 years after the Roe v Wade decision While abortion is still available in America everyone is having to pause and ask a simple question What do I believe about life Not what is convenient what do I believe about life I have been very outspoken on this floor about my frustration with the Biden administration I have not held back on this because they are the most pro abortion Presidency in American history They actively work on increasing the number of abortions in America and I find that not only appalling I find that painful that we as a nation have a policy of finding ways to increase the death of children That is not who we should be as a nation We should be working to be able to protect the life of every single child The most basic science that anyone will work through is if you look at this child in the womb there is no difference in this child and this child outside the womb That is the most basic of science If you want to look at science look at science but then ask yourself the personal question as well When does life begin The argument about abortion it is not just a legal argument Everyone wants to take it to a legal issue quite frankly because this body is a legal body but the issue of abortion is not just a legal issue and it is not just about making abortion illegal in the country I would tell you I am working to make abortion unthinkable in this country because we look past the convenience and look at this child s face and say Why does that child not deserve life like every one of us Because at its most basic level there is no difference between any one of us in this room and when we were at this stage right here in our mother s womb except for time So I ask this body a simple question When does life begin and are some children really disposable and some children are valuable That is the question each of us needs to decide and I am proud to stand with those who have marched for 50 years to say children are valuable all of them all of them I yield the floor
729	Mr President this past Friday tens of thousands of pro life Americans came to Washington DC to march for the 50th consecutive year to be a voice for the voiceless They marched because the pro life movement did not end with the overturning of Roe v Wade last summer They marched because the end of Roe v Wade represents a new beginning Thanks to the Supreme Court s decision in Mississippi s Dobbs case for the first time in 50 years the fate of the lives of millions of unborn children now rests not in the hands of unelected Federal judges but in the American people and their elected representatives I am grateful for the more than a dozen States that have answered the call including my State of Mississippi where babies in the womb are now legally protected even at their earliest and most vulnerable stages But the fight for life also continues here in our Nation s Capital and here in the U S Senate That is why it makes sense that this year the March for Life s route ended not at the U S Supreme Court as in years past but here in Congress As the chairman of the Senate Pro Life Caucus I am committed to fight for compassionate legislation to protect unborn children and their mothers We will be a firewall against the radical abortion agenda of Senate Democrats and hold the Biden administration accountable for its reckless and illegal pro abortion policies The contrast could not be clearer Last week the U S House of Representatives passed legislation that would guarantee the same basic medical care to babies who are born alive after an attempted abortion as would be given to any other baby born in any other circumstance I am appalled that 210 House Democrats voted against this humane legislation Apparently even infanticide is no longer a bridge too far In addition this month the Biden administration s FDA rubberstamped the reckless distribution of chemical abortion drugs by mail and telemedicine as well as retail pharmacies without ever seeing a doctor in person This decision turns retail pharmacies and post offices into abortion clinics The FDA s action provides no safeguards to screen by ultrasound for dangerous ectopic pregnancies and abandons pregnant women to suffering life threatening complications alone These can include severe bleeding infection potential surgical intervention and even death The FDA s promotion of dangerous do it yourself abortions is not only unsafe it is illegal Specifically the decision violates longstanding Federal criminal laws that clearly prohibit the mailing of abortion drugs This decision puts the profits and political agenda of the abortion industry over the science and clear evidence that abortion drugs present grave dangers to pregnant mothers and certainly their unborn babies Later this week I will introduce the SAVE Moms and Babies Act to reverse the FDA s reckless and illegal action and at minimum restore the basic health and safety requirement for these dangerous abortion drugs which should never have been approved The issue of abortion gets to the heart about what it means to be human Who counts as one of us Why can brutally killing a baby before birth be justified simply because the baby is inconvenient imperfect unwanted unplanned or dependent on her mother Rather than answer these questions about the humanity of the child in the womb the child sucking her thumb the child whose heart is beating and the child whose sonogram pictures are cherished as proof of life the abortion industry wants you to look away from the baby Over the past year we have witnessed millions of dollars of political advertisement spent to promote lies and fearmongering about the pro life movement and pro life laws and that try to pit unborn children against their own mothers As a mother a woman and a Senator I know we must refute these lies because each unborn child is not a threat but a blessing a unique and unrepeatable individual created in the image of God In addition the pro life movement cares for both pregnant moms and their unborn babies More than 2 700 pregnancy centers across the country provide critical medical and material support for women and families facing unplanned pregnancies Several of my colleagues have already introduced commonsense measures to support pregnant moms and families including through pregnancy centers As we move on from this year s March for Life and into a post Roe era we will never rest and we will never stop fighting until every unborn child is protected under our laws from the lethal violence of abortion I yield the floor
730	Mr President last Friday during the annual March for Life it was once again encouraging to see tens of thousands of young Americans travel to the National Mall to show their support for the most important human rights issue of our time the right to life This year we celebrate the 50th year that the March for Life has taken place marking a significant multigenerational milestone for this celebration of the sanctity of life The fact that this event is now in its 50th year is a testament to the truth and justice of our mission I thank and congratulate everyone who kept this movement alive for the past five decades and I especially want to thank all the brave pro life Americans who made their voices heard as part of the March for Life For half a century now Americans have brought their voices to Washington to halt the mass elective abortions of perhaps a million unborn American lives every year in our Nation Abortion is not a political issue to me it is a human rights issue And this is not a political battle we fight but rather the tip of the spear in a spiritual battle for the heart and soul of this Nation This year s momentous March for Life truly was a celebration as our Nation s Supreme Court has finally freed us from the undemocratic pro abortion decision forced on the American people in 1973 My prayer is that our God will heal the emotional and physical wounds that were ripped open across this Nation by this ruling As we celebrate this victory for life all of us should pause and thank God for giving us a majority of Supreme Court Justices who had the courage to overturn Roe v Wade This Supreme Court by an overwhelming 6 to 3 ruling defied the left s mob style intimidation tactics and in too many extreme cases they overcame even the vile threats on their lives as well as on their families safety and privacy The Court s majority stuck to constitutional principles and cast aside the pro abortion status quo even in the face of threats by the current Senate majority party and its current majority leader The way our Justices stood up to the opposition represents true leadership and the very best of America Let us commend our Republican Senate leader and the Senators who fought for the lives of the unborn who when we had control of the White House and the Senate had the courage the fortitude the willpower and the know how to shepherd three principled Justices through the confirmation process and ascend to the highest Court in the land This tremendous lifegiving decision also would not have happened without Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch and her team who championed their State s pro life law They forever etched their place in history The rights and lives of millions of American human beings are now protected as a result of the Dobbs decision As an obstetrician I had the honor and privilege to deliver over 5 000 babies and I want all those who stood tall in the March for Life last Friday to know that just like I fought for those babies in the delivery room I am going to continue the fight beside you to protect the sanctity of life and to show our Nation that Congress values these precious lives as well At the Federal level we of course have much more work to do on this issue We must continue to ensure taxpayer dollars do not fund abortions so millions of Americans are not forced to violate our own beliefs We must combat this administration s effort to remove conscience protections for medical professionals doctors nurses ultrasound techs and so many others who object to participating in abortion Perhaps most urgently we must reimplement safety restrictions on the abortion pill This unprecedented mass distribution of this pill by mail and over the counter that this administration is pushing will lead to thousands of women using it incorrectly causing medical emergencies possibly deaths and fetal malformations If you don t believe this can happen I just encourage you to spend some time in our emergency rooms where I and many other doctors treat numerous women suffering complications from the abortion pill Most of these patients are completely unaware of the potential side effects Many are misdiagnosed or perhaps victims of just a horrible guess at the gestational age of the unborn baby But I think it is also important that we as a party and Congress also work to further support legislation to provide resources to moms and babies in need This help would include more access to long term nutritional educational economic and social support as well as healthcare We must find more compassionate and effective ways to better encourage pregnant women who are contemplating abortion to choose life instead We need to open the doors to pregnancy crisis centers for assistance throughout and very importantly after the pregnancy Despite violent attacks acts of vandalism and harmful misinformation directed at these centers they continue to provide critically needed services to women all across this country I am also committed to dispelling the left s malicious lies about ectopic pregnancies in the aftermath of the Dobbs decision As someone who understands the science and practiced obstetrics for over 25 years and frankly treated hundreds of women with ectopic pregnancies I want to state that I agree with the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops We always have and always will support the treatment of women suffering from the always life threatening condition of an ectopic pregnancy The radical activists who wildly claim ectopic pregnancies will be left untreated because of this Court decision are simply misinformed and dangerously practice fearmongering tactics For a physician to not treat ectopic pregnancies would be No 1 unethical as well as No 2 below the standard of care for every community in America Let me close by saying once again thanks to all of you the tens of thousands of Americans who participated in the 50th March for Life for courageously and tirelessly fighting for life Each and every one of you is my encouragement You give me the strength and hope to wake up every day and join my fellow pro life Senators and millions of pro life Americans to fight to protect the sanctity of life Your being here praying together marching side by side arm to arm you strengthen my resolve and you can count on me to tirelessly fight to defend and secure the right to life for all human beings I yield the floor
731	Mr President thank you for your leadership and your desire to continue to lead in our country Everything I do here everything that most of us do here I think should come back to the dignity of work the idea that hard work should pay off for everyone no matter who you are no matter whether you punch a clock or swipe a badge no matter if you are management or labor no matter if you are self employed where you live what kind of work you do When work has dignity by definition the dignity of work brought to us originally by Leo XIII the labor Pope of 120 years ago with the Presiding Officer s faith he knows about Leo XII and brought to us by Dr King when work has dignity people have a secure retirement It means you count on Social Security and Medicare It means we protect people s pensions It means the VA continues paying benefits that you earned if you were exposed to Agent Orange or to these massive football field size burn pits It means people make enough money for retirement and for a rainy day It is why in this body just 2 years ago in March slightly fewer than 2 years ago we saved the pensions of 100 000 Ohioans tens of thousands in Virginia a million around the country people who worked their whole lives They earned the pension and the peace of mind in retirement for themselves and their families Think about what that means It is why we are still fighting for the Delphi retirees who again lost their pensions through no fault of theirs It is why we will always always always fight back against attacks on Social Security attacks on Medicare and efforts to privatize the Veterans Administration A secure retirement should never be a partisan issue On August 14 1935 President Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act Ever since that time it should not it was partisan then Most Democrats were for it and most Republicans were I will just say less for it But it has become a partisan issue far too often Social Security and Medicare are two of the most popular most unifying institutions of the country It is our government s promise to working men and women a promise that they will be able to retire with dignity You pay in every paycheck twice a month whatever and you are guaranteed that benefit Support for Social Security cuts across party lines It cuts across racial lines It cuts across geographic lines Americans not only want to protect Social Security and Medicare that goes without saying although many of my colleagues want to undermined it but they want to make these programs stronger But that is what Republicans I don t want to make this into a partisan issue but it has been unfortunately It is not what the Republicans in Congress want to do I want every American to understand that Republicans in Congress are planning to hold your Social Security hostage They have done it several different ways over the years So let s talk about it today They have threatened not to raise the debt limit Raising the debt limit sounds complicated and sounds expensive It is not Raising the debt limit said another way is about paying our bills paying the bills our Nation owes and keeping our word We did this three times under Donald Trump with no drama Their refusal to pay our bills undermines U S global leadership For seniors it would be a disaster It means that Social Security checks would stop going out It would mean that seniors won t get their Social Security checks if we don t keep our promises and pay our bills It is the first way this year that Republicans will attack Social Security Second they want to take this country and the American economy to the brink of default and then leverage their fiscal lunacy to cut your Social Security Ten years ago 15 years ago Republicans didn t act this way It is this new just going down the hall here you can see the other place the place where the other ones work The people who are the most extreme in that body clearly are trying to bring this country to the brink They are willing to take the U S economy hostage and only agree to pay our bills bills we have all run up including a huge part of that with President Trump and the Republican Congress with the big tax cut giveaway to the richest people in this country they are willing to take the economy hostage and raise the debt limit if Congress cuts Social Security The only way they are going to pay their bills is if Congress cuts Social Security That is what they are saying Let that sink in Congressional Republicans intend to use the fact that we need to pay our bills pay our bills that already have accrued to pay our bills is their tool for cutting Social Security You might disguise their policy as a commission Every time you hear the word commission and then they describe the next part of the sentence to reform Social Security you know what it means Their plan is to leverage this We are going to not pay our bills to cut your Social Security Finally there is privatizing Social Security The details differ The terms may change but the goal is the same to kill off Social Security by shrinking it and privatizing it and undermining public support It doesn t matter if you voted for this Republican or that Republican who sits at these desks or Senator Casey or Senator Wyden or Senator Kaine Overwhelmingly people who go to the polls and vote support Social Security and don t want Social Security privatized What is happening is nothing less than an attempt to go back on the bedrock promise made to America s middle class that Social Security would be there for them On August 14 1935 Franklin Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act In 1940 or 1941 for a woman in New Hampshire I think her first check was 24 I believe she was a retired schoolteacher and got the first Social Security check It doesn t matter to them to Social Security beneficiaries about all the politics here But we know that for Social Security checks people paid into the program their whole entire working lives Our government should work for people who paid into Social Security not against them When work has dignity we honor the retirement security people earned I urge my Republican colleagues in this body colleagues I point out with healthcare and retirement plans all of us with healthcare and retirement plans paid for by taxpayers our retirements aren t at risk Why should it be for Social Security beneficiaries None of my colleagues over here are saying Let s privatize the retirement system for Members of Congress They never say that They say Let s privatize Social Security Let s privatize the Veterans Administration in Richmond or Cleveland or Cincinnati Let s privatize Medicare They never talk about privatizing their benefits But think about the generations of Americans who have benefited from Social Security and the generations to come relying on the promise of Social Security and Medicare For the last part of my remarks Mr President I introduced a resolution affirming the Senate s commitment last year to protecting and expanding Social Security Dozens of my colleagues got on this bill including I believe the Presiding Officer a resolution affirming the Senate s commitment to protecting and expanding Social Security But you know what Not one Republican signed onto this resolution not one recommitted to the promise of the American people that if you work hard all of your life Social Security will be there for you What is more American what is more basic what is more family oriented than I pay into Social Security my whole life I pay into Medicare and if I get prematurely sick or disabled or when I retire why would we not honor that commitment Why do some Members of Congress want to privatize this program Because we know what happens when they are privatized The investors come in the banks come in and end up undermining it and there is less dollars fewer dollars available and less public support Americans shouldn t have to worry that politicians secure with government pensions are going to try to take away their retirement benefits that they earn I will again introduce that resolution probably next month affirming the Senate s commitment to protecting and expanding Social Security opposed to privatization I will again ask all my colleagues to sign on I assume we will get many I am hopeful this time hopeful that some Republicans join us Republican seniors in Ohio would support it It is just their elected officials so often don t People shouldn t have to worry if politicians who put our entire economy at risk by using this debt limit fight this are we going to pay our bills or not fight to cut social security but here we are I urge my colleagues to do the patriotic duty to raise the debt limit without condition without threatening economic calamity And I ask that you work with us to do what the American people overwhelmingly want protect and expand Social Security and Medicare and VA benefits I yield the floor
732	Mr President I rise to join my colleagues in a discussion about the right to life and what happened last week in Washington DC when tens of thousands of Americans of all ages races and religious backgrounds traveled to our Nation s Capital to march for life This March for Life was particularly special since it was the first March for Life after the Supreme Court s Dobbs decision which made this march a special celebration recognizing the unborn lives saved as a result of that decision I was proud to see many North Carolinians represent our State in the march by participating and fighting for the young babies who do not have a voice But for the voices expressed in the March for Life they would be unheard In January 1974 a brave group of committed pro life leaders led the first March for Life to advocate for a solution to the Supreme Court s judicial activism in my opinion in the Roe v Wade case This year the March for Life was not only an event to advocate for the unborn it was a celebration of the end of Roe and the return of pro life policymaking to the States and I believe to the Congress The Dobbs decision is historic and affirms my belief that all life is sacred Each State government and its duly elected representatives now make the determination about what types of laws they wish to have in place I for one continue to advocate for commonsense measures that the majority of Americans support like protecting life at crucial points of development and prohibiting horrendous procedures like partial birth abortion While it is good for us to celebrate the Dobbs decision as Senators we must remember that the fight for life in the United States is far from finished Our work to enact pro life policies must continue if we are to be a voice for the voiceless I believe Congress must vigorously pursue efforts to defend the sanctity of life Some have said since the Dobbs decision that this is something that only States should weigh into and I respectfully disagree Just 2 weeks ago I was thrilled to see the House pass the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act which I am committed to supporting This legislation would protect newborns who survive failed abortions born alive requiring the same degree of care as a newborn baby I urge Leader Schumer to bring this commonsense bill up to the floor for a vote as soon as possible Last Congress I cosponsored dozens of pro life bills This Congress I joined multiple bills to shape Federal policies toward protecting life This includes proposals that would prohibit the use of Federal funds for abortion and prohibit Planned Parenthood from using Federal funding for abortions When I served as speaker of the house in North Carolina we passed several bills to protect the unborn and to defend life and it was widely supported by the diverse State of North Carolina which is by no means a red State It is a blue State maybe a purple State But when you talk about what we were trying to accomplish the majority of North Carolinians supported it I ultimately believe that the States are best situated to set policies to support mothers and to protect life That is why it is critical that pro life advocates contact their State legislators and their Governors to ensure that lifesaving protections are enacted to defend the unborn in their respective States I am committed to continuing the effort to support life I am a lifetime pro life Catholic I make no apology for it because we are the voice in the absence of that baby yet to be born and we have to continue to fight for them I encourage my Senate colleagues to join me in doing this Mr President I just want to say that I hope that on this issue like so many that we tackled in the last Congress thorny issues that everybody thought nothing could get done I really hope that we can get people in a room and recognize that we can come together on some basic tenets get rid of the voices at either end of the spectrum that are preventing us from making progress on this important issue because literally the lives of the unborn their lives their opportunity is at stake

736	Mr President I rise today to recognize an excerpt of this article by George Black honoring the legacies of Senator Patrick Leahy and Tim Rieser that was originally published in the New Republic on December 19 2022 I ask unanimous consent that the following excerpt honoring Senator Patrick Leahy and Tim Rieser be printed in the Record
737	Mr. Speaker I come to the floor today to talk about the need for more American energy We are approaching the end of January Winter storms have been covering the country from Colorado to Connecticut We are seeing it everywhere Temperatures drop Energy prices go up In a typical year cold actually kills more Americans than extreme heat This winter millions of families are in danger of being left out in the cold because of the cost of energy We know that more than 20 million households in America right now have fallen behind on their ability to pay their energy bills Record high inflation has robbed the American people of more than 10 000 for each and every family since Joe Biden has become President Just look at what people were paying for things before he came into office and what they are paying today As a result people are able to save less and they are having to pay more We know that about two out of three American households are living paycheck to paycheck Personal savings in this country is now at a record low household debt is at a record high People are having to borrow more money and put things on the credit card at higher and higher interest rates At the same time energy prices are dramatically higher than they were the day Joe Biden took office The cost of heating oil is up by two thirds Natural gas is higher now than in a long time Electricity is up by 20 cents on the dollar As a result there is actually the risk of people having their energy and their electricity shut off this winter Some are doing it voluntarily because they don t want the big bill that is going to come It is hard to believe that it is happening here in the wealthiest country in the world We have enough energy to keep every American warm this winter Some of it they won t let us get out of the ground but we have it So it is an absolute disgrace with the energy resources we have in this country that Americans are facing brownouts and blackouts from an energy standpoint because of the Biden administration s radical climate policies Millions and millions of Americans are living with financial fear and with massive frustration at this administration for ignoring the needs of the people So what are the Democrats doing about it Nothing Joe Biden actually sold some of our emergency Strategic Petroleum Reserve to China You wouldn t believe that yet it happened Our petroleum reserve is for America It is for emergencies It is for natural disasters It is for war It is not for China This week I am introducing legislation to make sure this never happens again The House has already passed this legislation The vote was completely bipartisan more than 100 Democrats voted for it in the House There is no reason it shouldn t be bipartisan here in the Senate as well So I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in this effort The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is for us It is not for our enemies Joe Biden has promised to use our tax dollars I mean it is astonishing He went to the United Nations and said he was going to give 11 billion a year to the United Nations for climate reparations for energy we have used giving away American dollars when Americans can t afford to pay for energy costs here at home Why is he doing it If you listen to his speech it is because he wants to say he is sorry That is what we have a President who wants to apologize once again for America He wants us to feel guilty about the fact that we have built the strongest economy in the world by using oil gas coal all of the energy resources that we have in this country The American people have nothing to apologize for Joe Biden is wrong We shouldn t apologize for being an energy superpower We shouldn t apologize for using our energy resources If he wants to apologize he ought to be apologizing to the people of the United States for the policies he has put in place that have driven up costs and caused pain for families all across America He should apologize for raising taxes on American energy He should apologize for wasting tax dollars The Secretary of Energy his Secretary of Energy has given more than 200 million in loans to companies in China The Secretary of the Treasury is going to China soon She met with China s Vice Premier recently in Switzerland According to the Treasury Department she agreed to enhance cooperation with China on climate finance as well as support for developing countries in their clean energy transitions in other words more American taxpayer dollars for other people in other countries Again the excuse for all of this is climate The Democrats in Washington are utterly obsessed with the green dreams of the coastal elites who run the Democratic Party who call the tune Again and again the Democrats side with the climate elites over the common folks I hear it in Wyoming I hear it no matter where I travel in the country The Democrats are offering working families nothing more than higher taxes and higher prices and they continue to raise taxes The Democrats just threatened to ban natural gas stoves Nearly half of the homes in America use natural gas This is the administration a nominee by the President That is what he said He didn t say it once He said it repeatedly The Democrats also just raised taxes on coal by more than 1 billion So what happens with all of these new taxes They get handed down to working families in Wyoming and across America What happens with higher taxes It means higher prices and higher energy costs Janet Yellen is flying around the world and offering more of our tax dollars to these other countries Last week there was a large Democrat political rally held in Switzerland at a place called Davos The masters of the universe flew to Switzerland for the World Economic Forum From the television reports and the news reports much of the conversation was about climate The President s energy climate czar John Kerry was there He gave a speech You talk about somebody with smug superiority he just thinks he knows better than anybody else Here is what he said This is from John Kerry It s extraordinary that we a select group of human beings are able to talk about saving the planet Thank you John Kerry You are going to save us all I can hardly wait He added If you say that to most people they think you re just a crazy tree hugging lefty liberal do gooder but that s where we are Well John Kerry you are right Most people certainly anybody in Wyoming who would listen to you would say you are just a crazy tree hugging lefty liberal do gooder That is who we have got from the President of the United States doing his climate bidding in Switzerland This is exactly what people think about John Kerry and the climate crisis and the positions of this administration As if one failed Presidential nominee and candidate weren t embarrassing enough then we had a real Vice President who came to speak a former Vice President named Al Gore Anyone watching Al Gore speak would say that basically he descended into an unhinged rant About what Well climate of course That is all he ever rants about The former Democrat Senator and Vice President said we are boiling the oceans That is what we are doing apparently he said if we don t obey his energy policies Well I am sure he and John Kerry have great times together Boiling the oceans He even said we are creating what he called rain bombs He wants to save the planet as well and I would say What planet is he on That is what we are seeing coming out of this administration as their voice on the world stage When it comes to energy what are the Democrats offering A fairytale a fantasy and a fraud That is what we hear from the Democrats The Democrats green dreams are causing nightmares for working families who have to pay for all of this The only green thing about the Democrats energy agenda is how much green it costs American families John Kerry said it himself He said How do we get there And he said Money money money That is his answer American money American dollars and he is going to save the planet Europe has already tried its own Green New Deal It has been a disaster for the working people of those countries We can t let that happen here We just cannot The International Energy Agency projects a record high demand for oil later this year This is at a time when Joe Biden is making us keep it in the ground Wyoming is the energy breadbasket of the Nation We have it It is affordable It is available It is reliable That is not good enough for Joe Biden No He wants to go to Iran go to Venezuela go to Saudi Arabia with hat in hand and beg them to produce more and send it here It is interesting listening to the climate elites as they are fixated on renewable energy regardless of the costs and regardless of the consequences The Democrats need to stop this science fiction It is long past time for America to unleash our energy and stop this foolishness coming from the administration that has us buying energy from our enemies instead of selling it to our friends We have an abundance of American energy and the Democrats want to keep it buried in the ground For every American family who is struggling to make ends meet and is falling further behind because of the inflation caused by the Democrats spending it is time to unleash American energy right now
738	Mr. Speaker President Biden on June 3 2021 issued a memorandum on Establishing the Fight Against Corruption as a Core United States National Security Interest I want to quote from the President when he issued that memorandum President Biden said Corruption threatens United States national security economic equity global anti poverty and development efforts and democracy itself B y effectively preventing and countering corruption and demonstrating the advantages of transparent and accountable governance we can secure a critical advantage for the United States and other democracies Corruption is a national security core interest Corruption is the source of Mr Putin s resources that he uses for his international activities including the war in Ukraine and to try to bring down democratic states Today the Atlantic Council is releasing a report the report titled Why the kleptocrats still win A strategy for the United States and Europe to address weaponized corruption The report points out how the kleptocrats hide their wealth in Western countries because they believe it is safer in Western countries to hide their wealth And the report points out the need for us to coordinate efforts between the United States and Europe Today I am filing legislation the Combating Global Corruption Act I am joined by my friend Senator Todd Young of Indiana bipartisan legislation to deal with the U S leadership in fighting global corruption It will give the State Department and the United States an important tool It will give the United States leadership in showing the international community the steps that need to be taken in order to counter corruption It would require the State Department to publish a list of countries in three tiers the highest tier being those countries that are taking the steps necessary to fight corruption the bottom tier would be those countries that are not making the required effort to deal with corruption in their country The State Department will be using internationally established standards for fighting corruption that the international community has already signed off on as being the proper way to fight corruption in your particular state For example it references the Inter American Convention Against Corruption the Organization of American States the OAS that was passed in 1996 acknowledged procedures in our hemisphere to deal with corruption It references the Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials international business transactions of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development the OECD which was adopted in 1997 It references the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime that was agreed to in 2000 and the United Nations Convention against Corruption which was agreed to in 2003 These guidelines already exist and allow the United States to use those guidelines that have already been established by the global community to judge how every state is meeting their commitment to fight corruption Countries that are not meeting their commitment we put a spotlight on them That spotlight encourages them to do more It points out ways in which they can take action to fight corruption in their own country Now this is not a new strategy that we just came up with that we start giving a report on all countries on how well they are doing in fighting corruption It is not a new concept We have done that successfully in several other areas One that we should take great pride in this institution because we were ones who established this is the Trafficking in Persons requirements Today the United States files a report on every country as to how well they are meeting their international responsibilities to protect the modern victims of slavery trafficking in persons It has been bipartisan It has been very effective Secretary of State Blinken said in releasing the report of this year on July 19 2022 he said Today we re releasing the 2022 Trafficking in Persons Report It assesses how 188 countries and territories including the United States are performing in terms of preventing trafficking protecting victims prosecuting traffickers That makes this one of the most comprehensive sources of information anywhere on anti trafficking efforts by government what works what doesn t and how we can continue to do better We do that in preventing trafficking We can do that in stopping corruption We have a country report on human rights Again I will quote from Secretary of State Blinken when he released this report on April 2 2022 This is a report that judges all countries on how well they are dealing with human rights Secretary Blinken said in releasing that report on April 2 of last year For nearly five decades the United States has issued the Country Reports on Human Rights Practices which strive to provide a factual and objective record on the status of human rights worldwide in 2021 covering 198 countries and territories The information contained in these reports could not be more vital or urgent given ongoing human rights abuses and violations in many countries continued democratic backsliding on several continents and creeping authoritarianism that threatens both human rights and democracy most notably at present with Russia s unprovoked attack on Ukraine A nd using resources like the Country Reports on Human Rights Practices we can come closer to building a world where respect for human rights is truly universal That human rights report works Putting a spotlight on what countries need to do brings about change It promotes a core value in the United States respect for human rights and good governance We do that here in the United States to show global leadership I will mention one other report that is issued by our State Department one on international religious freedom Again this was bipartisan So on June 2 of last year Secretary Blinken said when he released the International Religious Freedom Report This report offers a thorough fact based review of the state of religious freedom in nearly 200 countries and territories around the world We produced this document every year since 1998 Now more than two decades later we have more than 35 governments and multilateral organizations that have created offices that are dedicated to this goal This year s report includes several countries where we see notable progress thanks to the work of governments civil society organizations and citizens For example last year the Kingdom of Morocco launched an initiative to renovate Jewish heritage sites like synagogues and cemeteries and to include Jewish history in the Moroccan public school curriculum T his report is about spreading that kind of progress to more parts of the world Unfortunately the report also shows that we have more work to do There is value in what we do in showing the international community what works what doesn t work what countries are doing to make progress whether it is on trafficking whether it is on human rights whether it is on religious freedom And we need to do the same on fighting corruption We had the model that works And the legislation that Senator Young and I have introduced today allows us to provide such a report in fighting corruption The legislation also gives the Secretary of State some additional tools that could be helpful The bill directs the Secretary of State and Treasury to evaluate whether there are foreign persons engaged in significant corruption for the purposes of potential imposition of sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act in the countries listed in tier 3 That is the lowest performing tier I mention that because the Magnitsky Sanctions have had a proud history in this Chamber We initiated the Magnitsky Sanctions originally against Russia because of the torture and death of Sergei Magnitsky We then made it global for those that are perpetrating gross violations of international human rights I introduced the legislation with my partner who was the late Senator McCain The two of us said we need to include corruption as one of the basic human rights violations that would be eligible for individual sanctions And we did In the last Congress we made the Global Magnitsky Sanctions permanent And I was proud that we were able to do that in the National Defense Authorization Act What is unique by these sanctions is that they are individual They are not against the country They are personal to the individual who violates the basic rights And what does it do It prevents them from getting a visa to come to America because they like to visit their wealth that is here in our country And it prevents them from using our banking system It works It was reportedly the first issue between Mr Putin and President Trump in their first bilateral summit meeting Mr Putin was upset about these sanctions Good I am glad that he is This legislation that Senator Young and I have introduced allows us to look at whether we should be using these individual sanctions these Magnitsky Sanctions against the perpetrators of corruption who have not been held accountable in their own country There is lot to be said about why this legislation is so important So I would like to just conclude by pointing out the bill that we introduced today is nearly identical to the bill that we introduced in the last Congress It was reported out on a bipartisan basis by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee I want to thank Senator Menendez for his help and Senator Risch for his help This is not a partisan bill This is a bipartisan bill to promote an American value and a national security concern and that is making sure that America leads in fighting corruption so we do not have the resources going into a country like Russia where Mr Putin uses it to try to bring down our system of government I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator Young in this effort I hope that we are able to pass this bill quickly in the U S Senate We came close to doing it in the last Congress We can get it passed in the House and signed by the President I think we will look back at this day when that report comes out and say that we were able to accomplish concrete improvements in making this world a better place in promoting American values that this report will make a difference
739	Mr. Speaker I come to the floor today to talk about the need for more American energy We are approaching the end of January Winter storms have been covering the country from Colorado to Connecticut We are seeing it everywhere Temperatures drop Energy prices go up In a typical year cold actually kills more Americans than extreme heat This winter millions of families are in danger of being left out in the cold because of the cost of energy We know that more than 20 million households in America right now have fallen behind on their ability to pay their energy bills Record high inflation has robbed the American people of more than 10 000 for each and every family since Joe Biden has become President Just look at what people were paying for things before he came into office and what they are paying today As a result people are able to save less and they are having to pay more We know that about two out of three American households are living paycheck to paycheck Personal savings in this country is now at a record low household debt is at a record high People are having to borrow more money and put things on the credit card at higher and higher interest rates At the same time energy prices are dramatically higher than they were the day Joe Biden took office The cost of heating oil is up by two thirds Natural gas is higher now than in a long time Electricity is up by 20 cents on the dollar As a result there is actually the risk of people having their energy and their electricity shut off this winter Some are doing it voluntarily because they don t want the big bill that is going to come It is hard to believe that it is happening here in the wealthiest country in the world We have enough energy to keep every American warm this winter Some of it they won t let us get out of the ground but we have it So it is an absolute disgrace with the energy resources we have in this country that Americans are facing brownouts and blackouts from an energy standpoint because of the Biden administration s radical climate policies Millions and millions of Americans are living with financial fear and with massive frustration at this administration for ignoring the needs of the people So what are the Democrats doing about it Nothing Joe Biden actually sold some of our emergency Strategic Petroleum Reserve to China You wouldn t believe that yet it happened Our petroleum reserve is for America It is for emergencies It is for natural disasters It is for war It is not for China This week I am introducing legislation to make sure this never happens again The House has already passed this legislation The vote was completely bipartisan more than 100 Democrats voted for it in the House There is no reason it shouldn t be bipartisan here in the Senate as well So I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in this effort The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is for us It is not for our enemies Joe Biden has promised to use our tax dollars I mean it is astonishing He went to the United Nations and said he was going to give 11 billion a year to the United Nations for climate reparations for energy we have used giving away American dollars when Americans can t afford to pay for energy costs here at home Why is he doing it If you listen to his speech it is because he wants to say he is sorry That is what we have a President who wants to apologize once again for America He wants us to feel guilty about the fact that we have built the strongest economy in the world by using oil gas coal all of the energy resources that we have in this country The American people have nothing to apologize for Joe Biden is wrong We shouldn t apologize for being an energy superpower We shouldn t apologize for using our energy resources If he wants to apologize he ought to be apologizing to the people of the United States for the policies he has put in place that have driven up costs and caused pain for families all across America He should apologize for raising taxes on American energy He should apologize for wasting tax dollars The Secretary of Energy his Secretary of Energy has given more than 200 million in loans to companies in China The Secretary of the Treasury is going to China soon She met with China s Vice Premier recently in Switzerland According to the Treasury Department she agreed to enhance cooperation with China on climate finance as well as support for developing countries in their clean energy transitions in other words more American taxpayer dollars for other people in other countries Again the excuse for all of this is climate The Democrats in Washington are utterly obsessed with the green dreams of the coastal elites who run the Democratic Party who call the tune Again and again the Democrats side with the climate elites over the common folks I hear it in Wyoming I hear it no matter where I travel in the country The Democrats are offering working families nothing more than higher taxes and higher prices and they continue to raise taxes The Democrats just threatened to ban natural gas stoves Nearly half of the homes in America use natural gas This is the administration a nominee by the President That is what he said He didn t say it once He said it repeatedly The Democrats also just raised taxes on coal by more than 1 billion So what happens with all of these new taxes They get handed down to working families in Wyoming and across America What happens with higher taxes It means higher prices and higher energy costs Janet Yellen is flying around the world and offering more of our tax dollars to these other countries Last week there was a large Democrat political rally held in Switzerland at a place called Davos The masters of the universe flew to Switzerland for the World Economic Forum From the television reports and the news reports much of the conversation was about climate The President s energy climate czar John Kerry was there He gave a speech You talk about somebody with smug superiority he just thinks he knows better than anybody else Here is what he said This is from John Kerry It s extraordinary that we a select group of human beings are able to talk about saving the planet Thank you John Kerry You are going to save us all I can hardly wait He added If you say that to most people they think you re just a crazy tree hugging lefty liberal do gooder but that s where we are Well John Kerry you are right Most people certainly anybody in Wyoming who would listen to you would say you are just a crazy tree hugging lefty liberal do gooder That is who we have got from the President of the United States doing his climate bidding in Switzerland This is exactly what people think about John Kerry and the climate crisis and the positions of this administration As if one failed Presidential nominee and candidate weren t embarrassing enough then we had a real Vice President who came to speak a former Vice President named Al Gore Anyone watching Al Gore speak would say that basically he descended into an unhinged rant About what Well climate of course That is all he ever rants about The former Democrat Senator and Vice President said we are boiling the oceans That is what we are doing apparently he said if we don t obey his energy policies Well I am sure he and John Kerry have great times together Boiling the oceans He even said we are creating what he called rain bombs He wants to save the planet as well and I would say What planet is he on That is what we are seeing coming out of this administration as their voice on the world stage When it comes to energy what are the Democrats offering A fairytale a fantasy and a fraud That is what we hear from the Democrats The Democrats green dreams are causing nightmares for working families who have to pay for all of this The only green thing about the Democrats energy agenda is how much green it costs American families John Kerry said it himself He said How do we get there And he said Money money money That is his answer American money American dollars and he is going to save the planet Europe has already tried its own Green New Deal It has been a disaster for the working people of those countries We can t let that happen here We just cannot The International Energy Agency projects a record high demand for oil later this year This is at a time when Joe Biden is making us keep it in the ground Wyoming is the energy breadbasket of the Nation We have it It is affordable It is available It is reliable That is not good enough for Joe Biden No He wants to go to Iran go to Venezuela go to Saudi Arabia with hat in hand and beg them to produce more and send it here It is interesting listening to the climate elites as they are fixated on renewable energy regardless of the costs and regardless of the consequences The Democrats need to stop this science fiction It is long past time for America to unleash our energy and stop this foolishness coming from the administration that has us buying energy from our enemies instead of selling it to our friends We have an abundance of American energy and the Democrats want to keep it buried in the ground For every American family who is struggling to make ends meet and is falling further behind because of the inflation caused by the Democrats spending it is time to unleash American energy right now
740	Mr. Speaker President Biden on June 3 2021 issued a memorandum on Establishing the Fight Against Corruption as a Core United States National Security Interest I want to quote from the President when he issued that memorandum President Biden said Corruption threatens United States national security economic equity global anti poverty and development efforts and democracy itself B y effectively preventing and countering corruption and demonstrating the advantages of transparent and accountable governance we can secure a critical advantage for the United States and other democracies Corruption is a national security core interest Corruption is the source of Mr Putin s resources that he uses for his international activities including the war in Ukraine and to try to bring down democratic states Today the Atlantic Council is releasing a report the report titled Why the kleptocrats still win A strategy for the United States and Europe to address weaponized

744	Mr Speaker friends of democracy are grateful that today the Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz announced in a speech before the German Federal Parliament that Berlin will send German made Leopard 2 tanks to defend Ukraine Germany is well represented in Washington with Ambassador Emily Haber Chancellor Scholz recognizes we are in a worldwide competition of democracies with Rule of Law opposed by authoritarians with Rule of Gun This was an historic decision by the German government and one which will help Ukraine in its time of need as a renewed Putin spring offensive likely draws near This decision will not only help Ukraine win on the battlefield and save thousands of lives but it will also enhance European and transatlantic security I am also appreciative that our Polish allies are making a vital contribution by sending their own tanks to support Ukraine There is no doubt that the decision by President Biden to finally send American made M1 Abrams tanks was essential in convincing our German allies to send the Leopard tanks to Ukraine However I am deeply concerned that it may take months for the Abrams tanks to reach Ukraine time that the innocent people of Ukraine cannot afford Unfortunately the administration continues to block essential weapons like the long range Army Tactical Missile Systems ATACMS which could help Ukraine win on the battlefield and end the conflict sooner The ATACMS are crucial for Ukraine to defend itself against attack from Iranian drone systems and Russian forces based in Crimea I call on President Biden to do the right thing and give Ukraine what it needs I especially appreciate Germany in that my home county of Lexington South Carolina was originally named Saxe Gotha being settled by enterprising German farmers Also my maternal family was significantly German with my ancestor Daniel Weisiger born in Frankfort in 1803 immigrating from Rotherdam in 1830 to Philadelphia then to Chesapeake Virginia I am named for his son David Addison Weisiger of Petersburg Virginia God Bless the United States of America God Bless Germany God Bless Ukraine God Bless President Volodymyr Zelenskyy Ukraine will achieve victory

756	Mr. Speaker almost 11 years ago today I spoke on the anniversary of two Chicago treasures Radio station WXRT and one of its beloved hosts Lin Brehmer This weekend we lost Lin at the age of 68 after a long battle with cancer Lin was a Chicago icon a poet a Renaissance man and a friend For my colleagues who have not lived in Chicago let me explain In the movie Almost Famous there is a scene where the protagonist s oldest sister has left her record collection and she tells him Look under your bed It will set you free That is what XRT did for us in Chicago and that is what Lin did for me and so many Chicagoans Before XRT AM radio a dry repetitive desert was our only option for music After XRT we were transformed It became a 24 hour station in 1976 demonstrating our city s unique commitment to independent thinking and an unbridled celebration of art and music Like many others XRT linked us to a new world XRT encouraged me to leave my sterile environment and travel to the Earl of Old Town to see Steve Goodman and my first concert at the Aragon Ballroom to see Mott the Hoople and the New York Dolls not to mention other famous haunts like the Metro the Vic Checkerboard Lounge to see greats like Iggy Pop David Bowie Muddy Waters Frank Zappa Roxy Music and so many others When Lin became the music director at WXRT in 1984 he helped introduce us to new music new genres and new emotions Today when so much of music is driven by algorithms and data it can be difficult to imagine a time when a station could often be steered by a single man s eclectic tastes but that is what Lin did He played what he wanted to hear and somehow he always knew what the city needed to hear He opened my eyes to the true power of music He taught me that music can show you new worlds can help you understand new perspectives It can often soothe during difficult times and inspire you to explore what you never considered exploring before Lin Brehmer was my friend but I recognize that I am far from the only one who could claim that coveted title He was born a New Yorker and began his radio career filling in at his university s student run station during the summer The first song he ever performed was The Beatles Within You Without You Later he would explain that he chose it because I have always felt that life flows within you but most of all without you At Albany s WQBK FM he became known as the Reverend of Rock n Roll for his penchant for reciting poetry during song introductions Lin came to Chicago in 1984 to become the music director and his taste left an indelible mark on the station and on the entire city He hosted the morning drive for more than 30 years talking to thousands of Chicagoans over the years on their daily commutes He loved the Cubs Chicago s music theater and dining and he shared those loves with us From Lin we learned about the best restaurants in the city We shared in the Cubs wins and often losses and gained new perspectives from his essays in Lin s Bin a rare combination of nostalgia humor empathy kindness and spirituality I was honored to have lunch with Lin at some of Chicago s most iconic locales like Manny s and Ann Sather s and to have spent a memorable Cubs game at his side As he himself described he regularly went out in his eating pants an outfit with enough give to accommodate another Chicago meal at places like the Wiener s Circle Last July he shared with his listeners that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and began a leave of absence to undergo treatment This November I know I wasn t the only Chicagoan who was delighted when he briefly returned to the airwaves Now during his time at WXRT he was named music director of the year three times and was voted the music director of the decade by readers of the Hard Report He was so much more than a radio host He was Chicago s best friend in the whole world When something big happened Chicago would turn to Lin for his take on the events Whether celebration or tragedy he knew what to say Now in the wake of his loss we turn to the dial wanting He was married to his college sweetheart Sara and they shared a son Wilson They were both by his side in his final moments My thoughts and deepest condolences are with his family and with all Chicagoans as we mourn his loss In closing as Lin always reminded us never take anything for granted It is great to be alive
757	Mr. Speaker I rise to support the delivery of Abrams tanks to our European allies including Ukraine Let us fulfill any backup supply to assure NATO can check aggression by Russia anywhere on that continent Liberty for Ukraine needs no Neville Chamberlain moments Delivering Abrams tanks will help Ukraine push toward victory sooner rather than later Liberty s mission must be victory Russia s cruel and unprovoked war on Ukraine has produced a nation soaked in blood from one end to the other Putin views weakness and appeasement as a recipe for failure Across Ohio which I am privileged to represent and the Great Lakes region our fellow citizens and families have survived and often too often have fled oppression in central Europe at the hands of a predatory Russia We know the price of liberty Our patriotic men and women in the United Auto Workers proudly manufacture the Abrams tank in Lima Ohio They guard liberty every day Our workers build the finest equipment in the world so critical to victory Americans know what brave Ukrainians are fighting for and against Hasn t enough innocent blood been spilled already Onward Abrams
758	Mr. Speaker I was appalled to learn that multiple schools in Fairfax County Virginia withheld National Merit Scholarship commendation award letters from hundreds of students This is a problem When political ideology stands in the way of students success it is a problem When the pursuit of so called equity starts harming students it is a problem When school bureaucrats hold students back to hide their own failures it is a problem The education bureaucracy failed these students These students deserve to be rewarded for their hard work and these students deserve an education system that will lift them up not try to keep them down These school administrators were trusted with the future of these students and they broke that trust Shame on them Dual Enrollment
759	Mr. Speaker one silver lining of the pandemic is that it pushed more high school students to take dual enrollment classes With the ever rising cost of postsecondary education dual enrollment programs are a great way for high school students to save on college costs These programs allow advanced students to get a head start on their futures This is the case at Jefferson State Community College in Birmingham Alabama where high schoolers made up a third of the student body according to NPR These students are benefiting from extensive State expansion of a dual enrollment program The more education innovation we have the better Mr. Speaker we know that if a high school student takes at least one college level course that student is three times more likely to graduate from college than if the student didn t take a course We should give students as many opportunities as possible to shape their own education experience and encouraging dual enrollment is one great way to do just that Filling the Skills Gap
760	Mr. Speaker it is no wonder we have a skills gap For decades people have been told that a bachelor s degree is the only path to a successful career As a result fewer and fewer young people are choosing to learn skilled trades Without skilled professionals who will repair our roads homes and cars We need these men and women who aren t afraid to get their hands dirty Yet applications for technical jobs dropped by almost 50 percent over the last 2 years With a potential looming recession for those holding office jobs many might be disappointed they missed out on learning a high skilled trade Fortunately it isn t too late Many open technical jobs pay a six figure salary and businessowners are struggling to fill them If I had to give young people advice today it would be to consider learning a high skilled trade
761	Mr. Speaker today I address something that is near and dear to everyone s heart and that is food security One of my biggest concerns right now as I have become educated on the things that concern Americans is the fact that all around the world right now we are facing food shortages A lot of this is created by our own actions If you look in Ukraine right now you have food rotting in bins because of a war The breadbasket of Europe is not going to be producing crops in the next year because of the war In China you have massive pollution which is contaminating their agricultural output Meanwhile you have countries like India that are reliant on foreign fertilizer that are going to be choked off because of the environmental movement You have the Netherlands and Germany reducing their nitrates in their fertilizers which they haven t done since World War I which created a famine back then In the United States we have a third of our chickens and our eggs that are being reduced because of Avian Flu Meanwhile we are allowing Chinese nationals and billionaires to buy up millions of acres of farmland This is concerning for many reasons If we thought that the pandemic was a reason for government to overreach if we thought that that was going to be a crisis imagine what it would be like if we ran out of food if we have food shortages When you realize that we had people panicking over toilet paper imagine what they will do when they panic when our cupboards are bare This could be a worldwide reason for war It is also another reason for government to increase their control There is always a reason for people to turn to the government to solve the problems that the government created and that is my main concern today to be something proactive rather than reactive We see it coming We can see that any foreign national country could come up with a virus to contaminate our livestock or even our crops and yet we are doing nothing to proactively make sure that Chinese nationals can t buy farmland in America that billionaires can t buy millions of acres of farmland and artificially increase prices during a food shortage We as Congress need to be proactive We need to reach out and make sure we are doing things to strategically protect our food resources both here and abroad We need to fight back this idea that the environmental movement shouldn t use fertilizer shouldn t produce agriculture shouldn t be having foresight to protect human life over all else Mr. Speaker I propose that Congress is realistic in the way we allow people to purchase I am all for a free market I am all for allowing people to sell to who they want to but always with the idea that America still comes first and Americans are protected in the process that we don t turn to the government to solve the problem that we are creating and that we don t allow foreign nationals to affect our food supply because this would be catastrophic both here and abroad and would lead to wars as we have seen over and over through the history of this world
762	Mr. Speaker I rise today to recognize the creation of a state of the art poultry science building at my alma mater the University of Georgia In the State of Georgia the poultry industry contributes an annual 21 5 billion to our State s economy The industry also generates an annual 2 1 billion in Federal tax revenue The poultry industry is vital to not only the State of Georgia but also the country That is why I am proud to recognize the University of Georgia for building a brand new poultry science building on their campus This 54 1 million facility will feature new classrooms research labs and learning labs These new labs will enhance the traditional classroom experience by offering students opportunities to learn in a fieldwork setting These facilities are vital for preparing students as they enter the poultry industry I know this new project will serve the students at the university and the people of Georgia s First District well Georgia Among LEED Certified Top 10

766	Mr. Speaker I rise to memorialize the life and legacy of Riverside County Sheriff s Department Deputy Darnell Calhoun Our communities were shattered again by a tragic loss On January 13 2023 Deputy Calhoun was fatally shot while responding to a domestic violence incident in Lake Elsinore California He was just 30 years old He was born in Pomona and grew up in Murrieta California where he worked at his family s restaurant Calhoun s Texas Family Barbeque In 2019 Deputy Calhoun began his career in law enforcement with the San Diego Police Department where he served for 3 years He then joined the Riverside County Sheriff s Department to be closer to his family You see that is the thing about Deputy Calhoun If there is one word to describe him it is devoted devoted to our community devoted to his church and above all devoted to his family He loved being a dad and raising his growing family with his wife Vanessa It is all he ever wanted For his children Russell Troy and Malcolm who is on the way your children my children and everyone s children Deputy Calhoun worked every day to make the world a better and safer place for us all A fixture in the community Deputy Calhoun could often be found at Covenant Grace Church serving brisket at his family s restaurant or out with the people leading the way on community policing He was an Eagles fan a good man with a servant s heart who lived to serve and a courageous deputy who put his life on the line for our safety As the Calhoun family fellow Riverside County Sheriff s Department officers and our entire local law enforcement community carries the heavy burden of grief anguish and sorrow with Deputy Calhoun s passing we must fulfill our solemn duty to honor and respect his service Today residents of Riverside County mourn the tragic loss of two fallen officers in the sheriff s department within 15 days of each other Mr. Speaker I ask everyone present on the House floor today to join me in a moment of silence for Deputy Calhoun Deputy Cordero their families and every fallen officer who has answered the call put their lives on the line and sacrificed themselves for our safety
767	Mr. Speaker I was very encouraged with today s reports that the Republican leadership is planning to teach their Members about how the debt ceiling works This is a very good sign especially after the embarrassing first week with 15 votes to elect a Speaker and the House leadership ending up exactly where it started Unfortunately the leadership is hallowed out but they have empowered the exact same element or any other faction who want to hold the Speaker hostage But there is a key difference going forward They are playing games with the full faith and credit of the United States which is underpinning the global economy Note the debt ceiling is not just a way station on the way to a full government shutdown While government shutdowns have real costs and consequences the debt ceiling has massive ramifications that you cannot unwind This game of chicken with the global economy is very much more consequential You can recover from the shutdown But the Trump attacks on professionals for example drove thousands of people out of government service and it is going to take years and millions of dollars to repair These implementations of political slogans have real consequences In the end I suspect we will be right where we started The only way to reduce the deficit to balance the budget books is to actually reduce government spending which they refused to do in the Trump administration when they were in total control of the government They instead had a huge increase in the deficit There were of course tax cuts that were a part of that unfunded and there was a major spike in military spending My friend Hal Harvey a leader in climate science is fond of saying that you can t refute science math and economics That is exactly the situation that my Republican friends are facing with this game of chicken with the debt ceiling There is no gimmick there is no commission and there is no slogan that avoids the painful truth that you actually have to reduce spending There are real things we could do I would suggest any Member could avail themselves of a secret weapon that is in each and every one of our districts There are amazing young people who are involved with civics with leadership congresses with the efforts to understand how government works I think we ought to employ them They understand the dynamic Cut spending raise taxes or just collect the taxes that are due and owing which would be hundreds of billions of dollars Unless and until we do this all the rest is simply meaningless slogans and posturing unfortunately with real risks of threatening the full faith and credit of the United States My friends have no alternative to the borrowing and I am afraid that we are going to end up going through this meaningless exercise agitating ourselves confusing the public and losing an opportunity to make real progress improving the budgeting process and making the tax system more effective to just collect the taxes that are already due and owing which we are ignoring I strongly encourage the process that my Republican friends are involved with in terms of educating Members about the impacts of the debt ceiling and I hope that we are able to come together to deal with the realities of what that implies
768	Mr. Speaker I rise today to discuss my plans for representing the Big First District in the 118th Congress As I have said on this House floor before the Big First is the geographic center and the pilot light of America because there the values that make America great are still alive and well faith family freedom and personal responsibility We are farmers ranchers feed lot managers businessowners lenders bankers teachers doctors nurses and parents My job is to serve and advocate for the people of the Big First which is why I am excited and grateful to have been appointed to the House Agriculture House Transportation and Infrastructure and House Small Business Committees As a farm kid and a fifth generation Kansan I am honored to serve on the House Agriculture Committee again in the 118th Congress Agriculture is the largest economic driver of the Big First We rank number one in beef wheat and sorghum production When I meet with farmers ranchers and agriculture producers I hear about skyrocketing inflation and record high input costs labor shortages government overreach and the importance of reauthorizing the farm bill We need well crafted farm and food policy in America to remain secure as a Nation and the reauthorization of the farm bill is an enormous responsibility My priorities for that legislation remain the same to protect and strengthen crop insurance promote trade and stop regulatory overreach I am committed to rolling up my sleeves and working for the men and women who feed fuel and clothe the world I am also honored to serve on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee The Big First has 83 000 miles of road seven commercial airports and more than 4 000 miles of railroad tracks We rely on this system to get to work take our kids to school and deliver food fuel and fiber to the rest of the world The people of the Big First deserve a voice on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and I am proud to be their spokesperson A well maintained fiscally responsible infrastructure network supports economic activity strengthens the supply chain and helps America to remain a global power During this Congress I will also serve on the House Small Business Committee The Big First is home to more than 200 000 small businesses which employ 80 percent of all employees in the district Small businesses help drive the American economy and define the American dream They add brick and mortar to the values that make our country unique like freedom self determination and the pursuit of happiness As a child I learned about the responsibility drive and decisionmaking skills required to run a small business from watching my parents operate our preconditioning feedlot and family farm I will continue to defend and support small businesses their owners employees and the American values that small businesses embody I am honored to serve on these committees and we have a lot of work to do Over the next 2 years we need to reauthorize the farm bill develop new trade agreements with countries that will benefit American ag producers and review the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act We need to reauthorize FAA and the Water Resources Development Act protect producers from a burdensome and overreaching definition of waters of the United States and ensure that our small and regional airports have the support they need We also need to maintain the stepped up basis return money to small businesses from IRS watchdogs and ensure that small businesses have a fair shot at government contracts I will be working on a wide variety of issues but I am bringing the same approach to all of them A Russell native Senator Bob Dole once told me about the Kansas approach honesty hard work respect for your roots service simplicity genuine thoughtful care for people and just plain common sense I learned these Kansan conservative values as a kid in the Big First they inspire my work today on all my committees and they will always guide my steps here in Congress Ultimately I believe that with prayer and hard work our brightest days are yet to come
769	Mr. Speaker I rise to talk a little bit about the national debt and accusations that have been made against my colleagues in the House Republican Conference I have listened as a couple of my colleagues from the Democratic side have accused us of playing chicken and gambling and have said they are glad that we are going to be educated on the impacts of a default on the debt I will tell you I agree with a lot of the consequences that have been outlined about the default What I want my colleagues to recognize on the other side of the aisle is that 2 days before Christmas a bill passed this House 4 126 pages and spent 1 7 trillion dollars That bill was negotiated among four people Speaker Pelosi Majority Leader Schumer President Biden and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell When President Biden signed the bill on December 30 what I want my colleagues to know is that we had already hit the debt limit on December 30 I have the Daily Treasury Report dated December 30 of 2022 The national debt subject to the limit was 31 347 trillion The statutory debt limit is 31 381 trillion Now technically we were 99 89 percent of the way to the debt limit For all practical purposes if you spent 99 89 percent on your credit card you are there The four people who negotiated it had to know that we were less than one tenth of 1 percent away from hitting the debt limit the day that legislation was signed All they had to do in that 4 000 page omnibus bill was write one sentence to change the debt limit to what it would have taken to fund their omnibus bill One sentence would have changed the debt limit in this country and we wouldn t be having the discussions we are having today about default but they didn t do that January 19 was 20 days after that bill was signed and now they are accusing House Republicans of being fiscally demented and not paying attention playing chicken and gambling with America s future The four people that negotiated that deal had four choices They could have passed a continuing resolution with a debt limit included They could have passed a continuing resolution without the debt limit They could have passed an omnibus bill and included the debt limit They could have passed an omnibus bill and not included the debt limit There was only one of those choices that would have led to the current situation where everybody points the finger at House Republicans and says you are gambling with The one choice that led to the current situation is an omnibus bill without the debt limit included Guess what those four with 160 years of political experience chose They chose the one that would lead to the current situation They could have included the debt limit in the piece of legislation that was adopted and signed on December 30 They chose not to You don t need to point the finger at Republicans and say we are gambling and playing chicken The fact of the matter is the four people that negotiated the omnibus bill knew exactly what they were doing This crisis was intentionally created and it is something that we are going to have to work together to get out of We have 32 trillion in debt In 2019 we had 21 trillion We can t keep running at a 2 trillion deficit every year
770	Mr. Speaker I know I am going to be the third Democratic speaker to talk about the debt limit but I think it is a point that needs to be made Mr. Speaker every single day Americans across our country are forced to take extraordinary measures just to keep a roof over their head and food on the table Now because of the extremist agenda of some of our Republican colleagues the Department of the Treasury has begun to do the same to avoid a default The consequences of such a default could be catastrophic The first real default in U S history could lead to a sudden jump in interest rates and raise mortgage car and credit card payments for our working families As the Federal Government struggles to maintain its financial commitments payments for Social Security benefits for veterans and paychecks for military servicemembers could be delayed and suspended By one estimate a default could add 130 000 to the cost of an average 30 year mortgage eliminate over 3 million jobs and increase the national debt by an additional 850 billion As much as 15 trillion in household wealth could be wiped out in the ensuing recession Our competitors across the world like China and Russia would surely see this U S default as an indication of American decline and be further emboldened As the Representative of Hawaii s Second Congressional District I speak on behalf of the diverse communities I represent spanning all eight Hawaiian islands I am here to fight for working families struggling with the high cost of living small businesses providing jobs and opportunities for our residents senior citizens seeking security in retirement in old age and above all our children and their futures In my first month alone on this job we find our country inching toward a debt crisis at the national level that could devastate my constituents and their ability to care for their families all caused by the extreme politics of my Republican colleagues This is not a short term one off issue The implications for our economy on our foreign policy and on our communities are severe and long term When I sit down at my kitchen table every night and look across at my sons I worry Will they have their own kitchen table filled with family in Hawaii If Republicans force our country into a default their future will be even more challenging to afford a home of their own or to be able to even rent one to own a car to get to work or to save for their children s future Hawaii is one of the most expensive places to live in the country with residents paying on average 42 percent of their income on rent the highest of any State I know that workers and families of every single one of our districts are struggling every day to make ends meet The American people need to see solutions not just grandstanding They need to see progress so that they can hope for a better future That means we have to build and act on the progress delivered by the first 2 years of the Biden administration and one of the most productive Congresses in modern history In these 2 years Democrats have lowered healthcare costs created nearly 11 million jobs supported over 10 million new small business applications put shovels in the ground on 7 000 new infrastructure projects and invested in a revival of American manufacturing This Congress should be building on the progress of the last 2 years not tearing it down by flirting with default and make unacceptable demands to cut Social Security Medicare and other critical programs that working families across the country depend on Why would House Republicans hold our economy hostage and the American people in anxious suspense for months when they can pass a clean debt limit increase right now When House Republicans tried to do this in 2011 they forced an unnecessary economic shock to our country that resulted in the first time our credit has ever been downgraded in our history We cannot do that again We can have a reasoned debate discussion and negotiations over the right level of government spending as every Congress does every year through the budget and appropriations process But whether the United States pays its bill on time must not be a pawn in a Republican political game Our families work hard to pay their bills on time their government should too I have heard from so many people how much they love Hawaii so do I If you have the chance to visit our home stop and take a look One in five residents depend on their Social Security benefits every single month Mr. Speaker 1 in 10 people who call Hawaii home are veterans or Active Duty servicemembers These are the faces of the people held hostage and hurt by Republicans We have an opportunity to rise above our differences and give them a Congress that has their best interests squarely in sight one that gives them hope Mr. Speaker I urge my Republican colleagues to work with us to quickly pass a clean debt limit raise as soon as possible The American people and our constituents deserve no less
771	Mr. Speaker last Thursday America s outstanding debt hit its limit As a result Treasury Secretary Yellen has warned leadership of the irreparable harm that will come to the U S economy if the debt ceiling is not addressed To avoid defaulting on our loans the Secretary has been forced to slow investments into the retirement of Federal employees and health benefits of postal workers Mr. Speaker let me remind you that this has been dealt with in the past Congress has dealt with the debt ceiling 78 times 49 times in Republican administrations and 29 times in Democratic administrations If it is not dealt with now the penalties will not stop at the actions that the Secretary was forced to take For 66 million Americans that receive Social Security checks every month and the more than 63 million Americans that rely on Medicare for care their benefits will be cut Interest rates will increase affecting car loans credit cards home mortgages and small business investments Tax refunds will be delayed and above all we will face a looming recession that will devastate our economy and result in skyrocketing unemployment and homelessness Let s be clear raising the debt ceiling is not giving a green light on wild runaway spending It is simply ensuring that we can pay for the obligations that we have already made Instead of working to resolve this issue Republicans continue to hold our economy hostage To threaten defaulting on our debt to secure service cuts is dangerous and shows little regard for the American people We have seen how this plays out we were there in 2011 when Republicans tried to pull this same stunt The delay in negotiations resulted in the Federal Government s first ever downgrade in its credit rating The Dow Jones fell nearly 2 000 points and it is estimated that it raised borrowing costs for the government by 1 3 billion I want my fellow Americans to remember this The Republicans are gambling on your money on your benefits and on your livelihood Mr. Speaker I urge my colleagues to act responsibly swiftly and without unnecessary delays or attempts to score political points Our Nation s financial stability and our constituents depend on it

775	Mr. Speaker I rise to sound the alarm Extreme MAGA Republicans have an economic plan that will hurt working families For 2 years House Democrats have delivered for everyday Americans The economic progress that House Democrats and President Biden have led is simply remarkable So let s talk about this significant growth Democrats have made possible by President Biden s economic plan We created 11 million jobs Under Trump we lost 2 9 million jobs The unemployment rate is at 3 5 percent one of the lowest rates in our history Under Trump it was 6 3 percent We lowered healthcare costs for working families Under Trump 3 million more people lost their insurance We capped insulin at 35 for our seniors on Medicare We expanded Medicare and Social Security benefits This is progress but this progress is threatened by extreme MAGA Republicans While most Americans are worried about post COVID prices at the grocery store the extreme MAGA Republicans in charge of the House GOP want to increase the average family s costs for groceries and everyday essentials by hundreds of dollars every month That is right Mr. Speaker raising it by hundreds a month They are doing this by championing a new 30 percent national sales tax The House MAGA Republicans would jack up the prices on the products that we rely on Imagine paying in my district 30 percent more when you go to HEB for your groceries This kind of blanket tax increase is failed economic policy that attacks the foundation of our economic growth and hurts working families My Republican friends all talk about responsible spending and balanced budgets Families will not be able to balance their own budgets if the extreme MAGA wing gets its way Mr. Speaker we have already witnessed what this so called leadership looks like The very first bill the GOP put before the House will make it easier to hand tax breaks to the wealthy and well connected They are not just trying to make it easier for the ultrapowerful to pay even less in taxes Sadly extreme Republicans want to gut Social Security eliminate Medicare and reverse new lower drug prices House Democrats just fought hard to get for working families If they have their way Social Security and Medicare as we know it will end Working families will lose the benefits they have earned by paying into a system for decades In my home district there are more than 80 000 people living on their Social Security income That is more than 10 percent of my constituents These are retired workers disabled workers widows and children who need these critical funds to survive Let me repeat They earned their benefits by paying into the system for many many decades When extreme MAGA Republicans fight and say they don t want to raise the debt limit I want everyone to know what that really means It is not economic theory it is political posturing They raised the debt limit every time Trump was in office and in fact Trump is responsible for 25 percent of our current debt When they say they are going to fight it really is about hurting people It would mean Social Security payments won t be sent and people already living hand to mouth won t get the money they earned This is totally unacceptable The full faith and credit of the United States means more than paying our government s bills on time It means keeping groceries in the refrigerator and medicine in the cabinet for many people in my district House Democrats will continue to fight for working families It is the middle class that makes our country strong We will always put people over politics We will always put people first
776	Mr. Speaker in what seems to be a concession to the most far right members of the Republican Party the Republican leadership has scheduled a vote on the alleged FairTax Act that would completely overhaul the tax system to blatantly favor the rich The proposed legislation would abolish the Internal Revenue Service and eliminate all Federal taxes including the estate taxes and corporate income taxes In place of Federal taxes the bill would impose an effective 30 percent national sales tax across the board The working class would face a substantially higher tax burden as a result and the richest Americans would receive a sizeable cash reward It is difficult to overestimate how regressive this tax would be and according to the tax experts it would have a wide range of detrimental effects not just on income taxes but also on items like Affordable Care Act premiums and the child tax credit The Republicans claim that they are the party of working people but they appear to be making an effort to demonstrate that they are absolutely not that Some of the wealthiest people in our country can pay exceptionally low tax rates avoid paying taxes on their largest assets and pass their fortunes on to their children tax free because of the many ways the tax system is set up to enable corporate taxpayers to avoid paying taxes Conservatives have spent decades creating this kind of tax emancipation for the rich while waging a fierce battle against attempts to reinstate tax enforcement against the 1 percent This just further advantages the wealthy by giving them more opportunities to take advantage of the working class In Florida s 20th District where the median household income is under 55 000 a year and families already struggle to make ends meet the FairTax Act will put my constituents at a unique disadvantage There is nothing fair about the FairTax Act This is a handout to the rich Americans will feel the weight of this 30 percent sales tax on necessities like food and gas Mr. Speaker I urge my colleagues to reconsider this legislation and work with House Democrats on the most pressing issues that face our country
777	Mr. Speaker I rise today to honor the life and service of Harvey Drahos a beloved World War II veteran who lives in the South Puget Sound of Washington State A member of America s Greatest Generation he joined the military in 1943 and rose to the rank of technician fifth grade Like many of our World War II heroes Mr Drahos was wounded on the front lines and as the Battle of Okinawa went on he made a promise If I survive I vow to help people Like many of his generation he made serving our great Nation and its citizens a cornerstone of his life s work Post military service he served on multiple service organization boards and dedicated 53 years of active community service and leadership to Washington State One piece of Mr Drahos story that stood out to me is that while on the battlefield in Japan he recovered a cherished photo album After decades of searching for the family it belonged to he was able to get it back to the Nakamoto family in Okinawa This selfless act helped a family reunite with their past loved ones transcending the boundaries of war with a kind act of humanity Mr. Speaker Harvey Drahos exemplifies courage selfless service and love for others He recently celebrated his 100th birthday and is the last living member of his World War II military unit I am honored and proud to recognize him for his service in combat and his love and compassion for our Nation Congratulating Alfie Alvarado Ramos

780	Mr. Speaker I rise today to highlight an ongoing problem with our institution which starts reminding one of a theater full of actors a circus or a dog and pony show with a lot of messaging grandstanding demagoguing talking points but no real results badly needed for the American people When Benjamin Franklin was leaving the Constitutional Convention in 1787 and was asked what kind of government the delegates had created he replied A republic if you can keep it It has been over 200 years since that time but do we really appreciate what it means to have a constitutional republic the rule of law presumption of innocence and proper due process As someone who grew up under a dictatorship in the Soviet Union I cherish these freedoms tremendously and I understand how hard it is to get them back when you lose them and how many people have died for them Therefore regardless of politics I will vigorously defend our Constitution and our rights for all Americans Congress is not a kangaroo court and has proper committees like Ethics or Judiciary to provide proper due process to all individuals whether it is President Trump and Representative Greene or President Biden and Representative Omar I adamantly argued last Congress as a member of the Judiciary Committee to provide this due process so I am not planning to become a hypocrite now and lose this credibility We have to become the adults in the room and stop the bread and circuses in Congress No one is above the law but no one is below the law
781	Will the gentleman from Massachusetts Mr Auchincloss come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance Mr AUCHINCLOSS led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all
782	Mr Speaker on January 11 the failure of the Notice to Air Missions system grounded thousands of flights across America This malfunction created air travel chaos for days This system is essential to safe flight operations and needs to be reformed The Notice to Air Missions Improvement Act takes a proactive approach to make much needed upgrades Many of the airline safety measures implemented over the past 15 years were borne out of the lessons we learned following the crash of flight 3407 outside of Buffalo We must not wait for another tragedy to make the necessary steps to protect the flying public I support this bipartisan bill and I urge my colleagues to do the same
783	Mr. Speaker I rise today to discuss H R 26 the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act that passed out of the House last week unanimously on one side but divided on the other except for one vote from a colleague from Texas I understand that the Nation is divided on the topic of abortion but that is not what this bill is This bill is to protect a living soul that survived a traumatic event This is one that I have been losing sleep over and I wanted to add my perspective from someone who fought in two wars What I don t understand is why we are divided because when I was overseas and my teammates and I my brothers and sisters in arms were actively engaging the Taliban al Qaida ISIS and at any moment whether it was an ambush or an IED if a hostile act was being presented to us and that individual relinquished their weapons decreased their aggressive posture we were to do the exact same If that terrorist if that individual was injured or shot we were to render medical aid We were to act humanely even after they just tried to kill us If necessary we would life flight them to the same hospital that an American soldier would go to period That rule of law was passed out of this body unanimously Every Member in this House demanded that American soldiers treat every human humanely period That rule protects individuals that because of the color of your skin they would crucify torture and kill you that because of your religious practices if it was not in accordance with theirs they would lock you in a cage and throw you in a lake If they did not agree with who you were what you were and how you were they would mercilessly hunt you down and execute you What I don t understand is how this body could unanimously pass a law that would protect somebody who absolutely despises our way of life but we cannot come together to protect an innocent child that survived an abortion I don t understand that I know that everyone in here is a mother a father a grandparent an aunt or an uncle and at any moment walking down the street if there was a child in duress you would kill yourself to get to them and save them but because this child survived abortion you are going to turn your back and vote not to give them medical care If this ever presents itself back to this body I humbly take a knee and ask that you change your vote and vote yes to protect these children
784	Mr Speaker I stand here today because I am planning to reintroduce the United States Israel Artificial Intelligence Center Act a bipartisan piece of legislation that will cement a mutually beneficial partnership between the United States and Israel on artificial intelligence research This is a critical step forward in an era where AI and its implications are taking center stage in public discourse We must collaborate with international partners like the Israeli Government to ensure that the United States maintains a leadership role in AI research and development and responsibly explores the many possibilities evolving technologies provide The United States Israel Artificial Intelligence Center Act will allow us to tap into the expertise of both countries and draw upon each other s resources to explore and develop cutting edge AI advancements

786	Mr Speaker since Speaker McCarthy won t tell us what he had to give extremist Republicans in his caucus in a backroom deal for power we can only assume that they agreed to tank the economy and destroy millions of jobs unless Congress slashes Social Security Raising the debt ceiling is a routine matter of business that has been passed cleanly by Republican Presidents including Trump and Democratic Presidents alike If Republican lawmakers default the shock will plunge the world into a recession and a financial crisis Let s not forget that 65 million Americans are on Social Security This debate is clear Speaker McCarthy made a deal with the devil in exchange for the power to hold our economy hostage and push through extremist Republican proposals such as Senator Rick Scott s plan to sunset Social Security We can t allow it to happen Tell us what to aim to cut and save Social Security
787	Mr Speaker I rise today in support of the people of Iran as they struggle against an oppressive and dangerous regime I also commend our great Iranian American community in Georgia and across this Nation who hope that their friends and family on the other side of the world may one day have the freedom and prosperity we all enjoy in the United States They are great patriots and valued citizens For 4 consecutive months Iranians have been protesting and calling for the downfall of the clerical regime in Tehran Their rulers have brutally repressed dissidents and protesters killing women who violate their dress codes and men who stand up for their sisters mothers wives and daughters In the 117th Congress 260 bipartisan Members of Congress cosponsored H Res 118 which expressed unequivocal support for the Iranian people s desire to establish a secular democratic and nonnuclear republic I hope that we can attract even more bipartisan signers for our resolution this week of which I am a proud cosponsor
788	Mr Speaker while I and my Democratic colleagues as well as the Biden Harris administration have raised Social Security benefits by 8 7 percent extreme Republicans are attempting to force cuts to Social Security eligibility and benefits that will hurt the financial security of America s seniors Their very first bill released the wealthy and well connected from giving their fair share of taxes adding 114 billion to the debt Social Security used to be a bipartisan supported program It is a vital lifeline for Americans and House Democrats will continue to fight to protect Social Security not only for our seniors now but for future generations Together House Democrats will continue to stand united in holding our Republican colleagues accountable and to push back against their efforts to subsidize the lifestyles of the rich and powerful
789	Mr Speaker Detroit is a city of firsts likely the site of the first urban freeway built in the U S where Henry Ford manufactured his first car and the birthplace of the U S auto industry Yes this city bleeds authentic Americana and yearns for a renaissance However my district is at a crossroads In the 13th Congressional District businesses are beginning to hire more people which means more traffic on the roads and more people using our public transportation system Metro Detroit was renowned for having one of the worst public transportation networks of any large city in the Nation even before the COVID 19 pandemic While others work from home many jobs require in person work Public transportation is still necessary and demand might rise in the future I applaud the passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act during the last Congress Still there needs to be a strong emphasis on infrastructure goals
790	Mr Speaker since Biden took office there have been nearly 5 million crossings of illegal aliens from over 100 countries a direct result of his failed policies and those of the Democrat led Congress Biden and Democrats shamefully support what they expect as low information voters ignoring the immediate threat of terrorists According to Customs and Border Protection last month was the 10th consecutive month of more than 200 000 illegal crossings Federal seizures have also resulted in fentanyl rising over 50 percent from November to December 2022 murdering young Americans The House Republican majority will deliver commonsense solutions to stop identified terrorists who are threats to American families at greater risk of mass murder than ever before House Republicans are holding the government accountable and will not stop until the American people are protected with a wall and fences as Donald Trump attempted to achieve In conclusion God bless our troops who successfully protected America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues moving from the Afghanistan safe haven to America
791	Mr Speaker I rise today in strong opposition to Big Pharma cheating taxpayers As pharmaceutical companies prepare to sell vaccines on the private market they are jacking up the price tag on our public health After tens of billions of dollars of sales vaccine manufacturers have floated commercial prices over four times higher than the price currently paid by the government Taxpayers contributed to every aspect of these vaccines from the underlining science to the clinical trials to purchasing agreements but only the manufacturers will profit Just two vaccine manufacturers control 97 percent of the market They will not compete because they do not have to I have worked on legislation to prevent anticompetitive pricing in consolidated markets like vaccines This is especially important for products that our tax dollars paid for We cannot continue to ask taxpayers to help cover the risk while letting Big Pharma collude to reap the profits
792	Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX the Chair will postpone further proceedings today on motions to suspend the rules on which the yeas and nays are ordered or votes objected to under clause 6 of rule XX The House will resume proceedings on postponed questions at a later time
793	Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr Speaker I thank the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico Mrs Gonzalez Colon for her leadership on this bill H R 255 is commonsense legislation to establish a process that is going to identify ways to streamline and consolidate the collection of certain disaster information While the Federal Emergency Management Agency or FEMA is the lead Federal agency on disasters there are often many Federal agencies involved in the disaster response and recovery process It is critically important that these agencies are all working efficiently to minimize overlaps in their assessments and utilize new technologies to streamline processes Specifically the legislation is going to establish a Federal working group led by FEMA to coordinate with the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency to identify ways to reduce duplication and streamline the Federal damage assessment process This is just a good government bill that will help improve disaster recovery efforts which were previously passed by the House in the 116th and 117th Congresses Mr Speaker I urge support of this legislation and I reserve the balance of my time
794	Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr Speaker I rise in support of H R 255 the Federal Disaster Assistance Coordination Act introduced by Representatives Gonzalez Colon Peters and Plaskett This legislation amends the Disaster Recovery Reform Act to help Federal agencies streamline and consolidate information collection and Preliminary Damage Assessments following disasters After a major disaster there is no time to wait for bureaucracy However Federal recovery assistance following disasters is currently hampered by inefficient information collection and assessments conducted by multiple agencies This bill will remove information collection barriers that currently impede disaster aid It creates a working group to identify duplicative assessments and propose their elimination Further it would streamline Federal disaster recovery efforts by concluding that a single agency is sufficient to conduct damage assessments to account for the needs of disaster victims The Federal Government can and should be doing this work smarter Mr Speaker I support this bill and I urge my colleagues to do the same Mr Speaker I reserve the balance of my time
795	Mr Speaker I would say first of all that I thank Chairman Graves for his leadership and for acting so swiftly to bring this bill to the floor of the House Mr Speaker I proudly rise in support of my bill H R 255 I thank Representatives Scott Peters of California Stacey Plaskett of the U S Virgin Islands and Neal Dunn of Florida for cosponsoring this legislation H R 255 would establish a process to identify ways to streamline and consolidate the collection of certain disaster information to start the recovery process for individuals and families that were devastated by any natural disaster Mr Speaker I hear about these issues with delays and confusion related to requirements and processing of disaster assistance on a regular basis I meet with mayors of the island and this is just in the case of Puerto Rico but I know we do have the same process and the same situation across the Nation This is a significant source of frustration for my mayors and my constituents as well as people all over the country While FEMA is the lead Federal agency on disasters many others are also often involved in disaster response and recovery like for example the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Small Business Administration just to name a few In the aftermath of Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017 and the seismic activity in Puerto Rico in 2020 we discovered that Federal agency after Federal agency would require the same information in their preliminary assessments which meant tens of thousands of site and damage assessments We see some of this repeating itself in the aftermath of last year s Hurricane Fiona in Puerto Rico and Hurricane Ian in Florida and with other disasters across the Nation This is not just a bill for the islands or the territories This is a bill for the rest of the Nation on how to manage and get expedited help and response from Federal agencies Currently there is no process to share these assessments among Federal agencies which ultimately causes significant delays for immediate relief and prolongs recovery This is compounded by other administrative issues like frequent staff changes and constituents and mayors having to work with multiple personnel to handle a single application or request In 2020 FEMA finally decided to begin consolidating assessments for Puerto Rico to speed up the delivery process across multiple Federal agencies Many of these assessments are small often one part of a larger project which has continuously slowed down the recovery process H R 255 would establish a Federal working group led by FEMA in collaboration with the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency to identify ways to reduce duplication and modernize the Federal management assessment process to make it truly agile and efficient We need to ensure assistance is provided while safeguarding taxpayer funds I think with this bill we can do both Mr Speaker I think it is critical that these agencies are working together to minimize overlaps in their assessments and consider the use of the newest technologies to streamline processes Very often we in the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee have these same discussions about what happened in Louisiana what happened in Florida what happened on the East Coast what happened on the West Coast every time we have a natural disaster It always is the same problem I trust this bill will expedite disaster recovery across the Nation As we have learned in Puerto Rico it is not if the next disaster will occur it is when it is going to happen and how we are going to face it Every 1st of June another hurricane season begins for the territories and the eastern coast Since the last time this language passed the House in the 117th Congress we had another direct hit with Hurricane Fiona I am pleased we are considering this bill so early in this 118th Congress and that is the reason I thanked our chairman for his marvelous job bringing this bill to the floor I can therefore work quickly to make this proposal the law of the land as part of our efforts to better prepare for disaster response Mr Speaker I encourage my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation
796	Mr Speaker in closing this bipartisan bill passed the House on suspension in the 116th and 117th Congresses It will help disaster survivors by taking a step toward streamlining the Federal Government s fragmented approach to disaster assistance Mr Speaker I urge my colleagues to support this bill and I yield back the balance of my time
797	Mr Speaker 2 weeks ago I stood on this very House floor and I voted to condemn violence at crisis pregnancy centers A vote that was difficult to make not because I think it was wrong to condemn violence I don t Rather it was difficult as an American to watch this governing body politicize the ideas of civility and decency that should be undoubtedly woven through every last one of us Mr Speaker I stand before you to condemn violence again this time at an abortion clinic I stand before you to acknowledge the violent attack at the Planned Parenthood in Illinois last week The cowardly arson attack a firebomb damaged the building just days after abortion protections were signed into law in Illinois Let there be no mistake this was clearly intended to terrorize women girls their families and the medical professionals who serve them from exercising reproductive freedoms Now I ask my Republican colleagues to join me as I have joined them in condemning violence and this violent attack From this day forward I invite all Americans to unequivocally say that we must restore civility and decency in every corner of our Nation because violence is never the answer ever
798	Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr Speaker H R 259 the Post Disaster Assistance Online Accountability Act introduced by our Republican colleague from Puerto Rico Mrs Gonzalez Colon will increase transparency for post disaster Federal assistance H R 259 requires agencies that provide Federal disaster assistance to update a central website quarterly with information on their disaster assistance programs This increased transparency is going to allow the American taxpayers to see where their hard earned dollars are going and which areas are receiving the most Federal assistance for post disaster recovery The Post Disaster Assistance Online Accountability Act passed the House last Congress overwhelmingly by a vote of 412 yeas to 2 nays I hope we can repeat this very strong showing this Congress Mr Speaker I urge support of this legislation and I reserve the balance of my time House of Representatives Committee on Small Business Washington DC January 19 2023 Hon Sam Graves Chairman Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure House of Representatives Washington DC Dear Chairman Graves I write concerning H R 259 the Post Disaster Assistance Online Accountability Act The bill was referred primarily to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure with additional referrals to the Committee on Financial Services and the Committee on Small Business Specifically provisions of H R 259 fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Small Business I recognize and appreciate your desire to bring this legislation before the House of Representatives in an expeditious manner and accordingly the Committee on Small Business will forgo action on the bill However this is conditional on our mutual understanding that doing so will not prejudice the Committee on Small Business with respect to the appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matter contained in the bill or similar legislation that falls within the Committee on Small Business s Rule X jurisdiction Further should a conference on the bill be necessary I appreciate your agreement to support my request to have the Committee represented on the conference committee Finally I would ask that a copy of this letter and your response acknowledging our jurisdictional interest in the bill be included in the Congressional Record during consideration of H R 259 on the House floor Sincerely Roger Williams Chairman House Committee on Small Business
799	Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr Speaker I rise in support of H R 259 This bill introduced by Resident Commissioner Gonzalez Colon and Delegate Plaskett would create a new online system for tracking Federal disaster projects and assistance People should know how and where their disaster funds are being spent without wading through reams of governmental paperwork This legislation simplifies the data collection process for Federal disaster recovery projects To increase transparency the bill also creates a page on USASpending gov where everyone can track agency disaster recovery activities and the amount of assistance expended by an agency on a quarterly basis Federal agencies need to be accountable to the victims of disasters and allow them peace of mind when they are at their most vulnerable Mr Speaker I urge my colleagues on both sides to join with me and support this legislation and I reserve the balance of my time
800	Mr Speaker I rise in support of H R 259 the Post Disaster Assistance Online Accountability Act Again I thank Chairman Graves for moving forward with this bipartisan initiative for making it possible so early in this Congress and for it to be considered today I also thank my sister from the Virgin Islands Stacey Plaskett as well as Representatives Malliotakis and Cleaver for their support and as cosponsors on this legislation H R 259 would provide an innovative and comprehensive approach to tracking Federal disaster projects and assistance as well as the funds It establishes a single online repository to report information about Federal disaster assistance to provide transparency to the American taxpayer This proposal developed in collaboration with the Project of Government Oversight would establish a subpage for transparency of disaster assistance on the USASpending gov website to better inform the public about the status of the use of disaster funding And believe me Mr Speaker every time I go back to the district every weekend this is the first question I receive from my constituents What happened with the funds to the bridge What happened with the funds to the school What happened to the funds to the roads that are still damaged 5 years after a hurricane Many people ask themselves these questions Where is the Federal funding that has been approved by Congress Where is the money that has been allocated to the Federal agencies Does a contractor have it Did the local government spend the money well Those are general questions that everybody at least in Puerto Rico are asking So this bill would require agencies that offered disaster assistance including the Department of Housing and Urban Development the Small Business Administration the Department of Agriculture and many others to regularly submit updated information to the Office of Management and Budget to ensure that the best possible data is available in an easily accessible format The data to be published would include the amount of disaster assistance provided by the agencies the amount of disaster assistance that has been obligated or expended to projects or activities and a detailed list of all projects or activities for which disaster assistance dispersed by the agency was expended obligated or used including a description of the project or activity as well as an evaluation of the completion status of that project I think this will help not just the general public not just American taxpayers but also the government agencies to know where the funding is and when those projects are going to be completed During the last few years my district like many others represented here in the House has faced multiple hardships due to disasters In Puerto Rico we are still working through the aftermath of Hurricanes Irma and Maria the earthquakes of 2020 and last year s Hurricane Fiona Much of the support has been approved for rebuilding this Congress passed legislation allocating billions of Federal funding not just to Puerto Rico but to Texas to California and to many other States and of course we need better accountability and oversight to ensure this funding is being used as intended by Congress H R 259 will foster accessibility and transparency of information to track Federal funding and its status It will also enable local mayors and legislators nongovernmental organizations and individual constituents to know what funding has been used for where the funding will go and how much funding is left to be spent among other information In Puerto Rico we have put money here for hospitals for piers and for bridges and people don t even know where the money is because the projects have not even begun yet This kind of information will not only help Federal and local agencies but mostly the American taxpayers This will allow better awareness of progress and utilization of resources and to ensure that streams of available funding are not overlooked or underutilized The transparency provided with this bill will be essential for better congressional oversight of disaster recovery in all the States and communities where it has been received so agencies can account for how effectively it is being used and if it is getting to the hands of the individuals and communities that need it and that it was intended to go to Mr Speaker passing this legislation will assist efforts to improve Federal disaster response and make it more accountable and effective I urge my colleagues to vote for passage of H R 259 the Post Disaster Assistance Online Accountability Act
801	Mr Speaker I have no further requests for time and I am prepared to close Mr Speaker the House passed this bipartisan bill on suspension as well in the past two Congresses I look forward to passing this commonsense transparency measure again today Mr Speaker I urge my colleagues to support it and I yield back the balance of my time
802	Mr Speaker in closing this commonsense accountability measure is going to enable taxpayers to get a greater sense of where their money is going and allow agencies to see where they can coordinate post disaster recovery efforts Mr Speaker I urge support of this legislation and I yield back the balance of my time
803	Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume H R 388 revokes the Securities and Exchange Commission s or the SEC s leasing authority for general office space and brings them in line with current leasing practices through the General Services Administration or the GSA In 2012 the SEC violated Federal law by signing a lease for 1 4 million square feet that cost taxpayers 566 million This resulted in investigations by the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the SEC s Inspector General The conclusions of these investigations indicated that not only did the SEC exceed its authority with this lease but also that the SEC had a history of mismanaging its leasing authority Recent actions by the SEC during GSA s procurement of leased space for the SEC seem to indicate that the agency may be turning back to its old ways This bill ensures that the SEC like other Federal agencies continues to use the GSA for its space needs and provides more safeguards for the taxpayers money Mr Speaker I urge support for the legislation and I reserve the balance of my time
804	Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr Speaker I rise today in support of H R 388 the Securities and Exchange Commission Real Estate Leasing Authority Revocation Act This legislation introduced by Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton of the District of Columbia revokes the independent real estate leasing authority of the SEC and directs the Government Accountability Office to update its 2016 report on Federal entities with independent real estate leasing authority While some Federal agencies have independent real estate leasing authority and have used it responsibly the SEC has a history of egregious real estate practices Congress granted the SEC independent leasing authority in 1990 which means the SEC does not need to use the General Services Administration for its real estate needs like most other government agencies do In 2010 anticipating the agency would expand in response to the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act the SEC leased 900 000 square feet of space in the Constitution Center building in Washington D C Then a year later in 2011 the SEC s Office of Inspector General issued a report which found that the SEC Office of Administrative Services conducted a flawed analysis to justify the need for this leased space and potentially committed Anti Deficiency Act violations SEC s Office of Inspector General found that OAS grossly overestimated the amount of space needed at SEC headquarters for the SEC s projected expansion and prepared a faulty Justification and Approval to support eliminating competition Thankfully Delegate Norton introduced identical legislation to repeal this authority during the 117th Congress and that bill H R 1468 passed both the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the House of Representatives with bipartisan support Unfortunately H R 1468 was not considered by the Senate Today we are trying one more time to approve this commonsense legislation Mr Speaker I urge my colleagues to support this bill and I reserve the balance of my time
805	Mr Speaker I thank the gentleman for yielding and I thank Chair Graves and Ranking Member Larsen for bringing this important bill to the floor This bill would revoke the independent real estate leasing authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission and direct the Government Accountability Office to update its 2016 report on independent real estate leasing authority in the Federal Government The House passed this bill last Congress While a number of Federal agencies have independent real estate leasing authority the SEC has a history of egregious real estate practices In 2005 the SEC disclosed that it had unbudgeted costs of approximately 48 million for the construction of its headquarters near Union Station In 2007 after moving into headquarters the SEC shuffled its employees to different office space at a cost of over 3 million without any cost benefit analysis or justifiable explanation In 2010 the SEC conducted a deeply flawed analysis to justify the need to lease 900 000 square feet and to commit over 500 million over 10 years overestimating its space needs by over 300 percent In addition the SEC failed to provide complete and accurate information and prepared a faulty and backdated justification and approval after it had already signed the lease In August 2016 the General Services Administration and the SEC entered into an occupancy agreement to authorize GSA to secure a new 15 year lease In December 2016 GSA with the approval of SEC submitted a prospectus to Congress for approximately 1 3 million square feet which Congress approved in 2018
806	Mr Speaker I thank the gentleman for yielding me more time By July 2019 GSA had received final bids resolved all protests and even selected a final bidder A month later the SEC canceled the occupancy agreement citing concerns about the value of the purchase option which SEC refused to document to Congress The SEC effectively vetoed the entire 3 year procurement process despite not having the authority or funding to exercise the purchase option without GSA s involvement Finally after much back and forth between the two agencies GSA entered into a lease agreement for a new SEC headquarters in September 2021 The SEC says it will continue to have GSA do its leasing in the future but the SEC s history of egregious leasing conduct having squandered hundreds of millions of dollars makes this bill necessary These public blunders also risk undermining the reputation of GSA and the Federal Government among developers and building owners who participate in Federal lease procurements The threat of uncertainty ultimately drives up the cost of all GSA real estate procurements It is time for Congress to return the SEC s leasing authority to GSA the Federal Government s civilian real estate arm As the SEC has demonstrated over three decades it is incredibly inefficient wasteful and redundant to have the SEC involved in real estate procurements when GSA exists for that very reason Like other Federal agencies the SEC will continue to have input with the GSA and involvement in the real estate decision making process but GSA would have the ultimate authority Mr Speaker I urge my colleagues to support the bill
807	Mr Speaker I yield myself the balance of my time to close H R 388 ensures that the SEC is going to work with the GSA on leasing to improve oversight reduce costs protect taxpayers against wasteful spending and minimize Anti Deficiency Act violations in the future Mr Speaker I urge support of this legislation and I yield back the balance of my time
808	Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr Speaker I rise in support of H R 346 as amended the NOTAM Improvement Act of 2023 Just 2 weeks ago Americans woke to the largest ground stop of aircraft since 9 11 due to the outage of the Federal Aviation Administration s FAA s notice to air mission more commonly called the NOTAM system As a professional pilot I use the NOTAM system on a regular basis and know firsthand just how important it is to ensure that it is reliable and functional This incident highlights a huge vulnerability in our transportation system As much as I wish we could say that this incident surprised us this kind of issue was inevitable Committee leaders have repeatedly raised the alarm about our woefully out of date NOTAM system This same bill has been introduced and passed two Congresses in a row and multiple laws coming out of the Transportation Committee have demanded that the Department of Transportation and the FAA step up and address the well known issues with the NOTAM system What occurred nearly 2 weeks ago is unacceptable and the American people deserve much better Hopefully this incident was the wake up call that the DOT and the FAA needed to shake off their ongoing failure to properly maintain our Nation s air traffic control system H R 346 as amended is going to help address this failure by identifying issues with the NOTAM system and proposing solutions to prevent an incident of this magnitude from ever occurring in the future This bill creates a special task force to improve the utility stability resiliency and cybersecurity of the FAA s NOTAM system Composed of representatives from airlines aviation safety experts and other important aviation stakeholders the task force is going to review existing NOTAM policies regulations and the system s overall integrity to determine best practices to increase the system s efficiency and decrease its susceptibility to outages which cause other disruptions Originally this bill was focused on improving the NOTAM presentation so that pilots and dispatchers could focus on critical information that matters In 2017 an Air Canada flight nearly landed on a crowded taxiway in San Francisco because the NOTAM informing them of a runway closure was buried on page 8 of 27 Mr Speaker we urgently need a better system and a more stable system I thank the gentleman from Minnesota Mr Stauber and the gentleman from California Mr DeSaulnier for their leadership and foresight on this particular piece of legislation H R 346 is a good bipartisan and timely aviation safety bill It shows that the people s House can rise to the urgent issues of the day Mr Speaker I support the legislation and I reserve the balance of my time
809	Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr Speaker I rise in support of H R 346 the NOTAM Improvement Act of 2023 as amended This bill was introduced by the gentleman from Minnesota Mr Stauber and the gentleman from California Mr DeSaulnier On the morning of January 11 the U S airspace came to a standstill when the FAA grounded all airline domestic departures for the first time since September 11 2001 due to an agency contractor mistakenly causing an outage of the FAA s NOTAM system NOTAMs are a critical part of our aviation infrastructure as they provide essential real time flight safety information such as potential hazards to pilots flight dispatchers and other airspace users Although the FAA worked to quickly solve the problem and lift the subsequent domestic flight ground stop the cascading effects of mass delays and cancellations were seen for hours I fully support the FAA s actions to ensure the NOTAM outage would not affect the safety of the national airspace system however our constituents deserve better They deserve to have both a safe and reliable national airspace system The FAA has moved to put several operational and systematic mitigations in place to try to prevent future NOTAM outages from occurring However the recent NOTAM system outage shows a clear need to reexamine and modernize the safety critical systems and legacy infrastructure that flight crews and airline passengers depend upon To help strengthen the integrity of the system this bipartisan bill directs the FAA to create a task force on NOTAM improvement to review existing methods for the content and presentation of NOTAMs to pilots determine best practices to prioritize and disseminate critical flight information to pilots in a way that optimizes review and retention and develop recommendations to ensure stability resiliency and cybersecurity of the NOTAM system This task force will be comprised of key aviation stakeholders including airline pilots air traffic controllers air carriers and aviation safety and computer system experts among others This bill is an important step in a series of efforts Congress and the FAA will undergo to modernize the NOTAM system Later this week the chair and I and other Members of this body will be briefed by the FAA Acting Administrator on the status of the preliminary investigation into the NOTAM outage how the FAA is responding to the incident and issues that Congress should be considering to further strengthen the NOTAM system Fortunately we are due for an FAA reauthorization bill this year giving us an opportunity to build upon the 2018 law and further implement any necessary improvements to safeguard the NAS from similar system outages The task force created under this bill will play an important role in the FAA s ongoing NOTAM modernization initiative to ensure pilots flight crews and other airspace users receive NOTAMs that are timely relevant and accurate There can be no compromises when it comes to safety in the national airspace As demand for air travel begins to meet and even exceed prepandemic levels this bill will help the FAA and the U S aviation industry implement best practices to improve the safety of the traveling public and the U S aviation workforce Mr Speaker I support this legislation and I urge my colleagues to do the same Mr Speaker I reserve the balance of my time
810	Mr Speaker I am pleased to rise in support of my bipartisan legislation that improves the safety of air travel I also thank my colleague Mr DeSaulnier for his support and leadership on this legislation as well In 2022 the United States was home to 8 of the top 10 busiest airports in the world This means that as Americans we have no room for error when it comes to aviation safety Although aviation is the safest form of travel we must always strive to be better This is why we must address the notice to air missions or NOTAMs system NOTAMs provide current up to the minute data to pilots on any aspect of their flight Unfortunately NOTAMs are often buried in lengthy reports conflating important safety information with more common alerts These inefficiencies have the potential to create life threatening situations which have just been mentioned On January 11 2023 all U S domestic flights were grounded for the first time since 9 11 The latest reports from the FAA suggest that the unintentional deletion of files caused this chaos No one person or one file should be able to take down our whole flight safety system but the NOTAM system is old and antiquated so it comes as no real surprise Unfortunately leadership at the Department of Transportation is more concerned with woke politics and changing the name of the system rather than appropriate upgrades for aviation safety Mr Speaker I have been advocating for NOTAM upgrades for 4 years now My legislation which creates a task force at the FAA with important input from safety experts and industry professionals to address both efficiency and resiliency of the NOTAM system has passed out of the House both in the 116th Congress and in the 117th Congress in a bipartisan fashion only to die in the Senate I encourage my colleagues in both the House and the Senate to pass my legislation before another failure of the NOTAM system occurs Our pilots crew members and passengers are counting on us Mr Speaker we do have a change in the 118th Congress The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is being led by two of my friends Chairman Sam Graves is ready able and willing to change how the committee works and actually bring forth legislation that is good for the American people and good for our transportation I have full faith in my good friend Ranking Member Larsen to do the same We have worked together in the past and I see this committee succeeding with the leadership that I have previously seen by the chair and the ranking member
811	Mr Speaker I thank the gentleman for yielding I also thank my partner in this legislation and Chairman Graves for his positive comments As was mentioned in 2017 an Air Canada plane at San Francisco International Airport got within 59 feet of crashing into four planes loaded with passengers putting the lives of more than 1 000 people at risk which would have been the greatest aviation disaster in American history When the National Transportation Safety Board investigated they found that the outdated NOTAM system was the largest part of the near disaster Since then I and others have been working with the aviation industry the FAA the NTSB and the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee to address the critical issues with NOTAMs Updating them and making them more accessible to the people who use them is essential to the safety of the flying public and the confidence of the users Earlier this month we learned what happens when there is an outage in the system chaos and grounded flights In response to the Air Canada incident I authored the Safe Landings Act which would work to improve many aspects of aviation safety technology including to the NOTAM system With Members of both parties and the chair and ranking member we have worked over the years to continue to hold the FAA accountable for the safety of passengers crew and aircraft In 2018 we included a requirement in the FAA reauthorization to speed up the modernization of the NOTAM system Last year more than 4 years after the provision passed into law I led a letter with Ranking Member Larsen to the FAA asking why the system was still outdated The mass flight cancellations that resulted from the outage further emphasized the need to make rigorous and immediate updates to the NOTAMs and brought public awareness to this critical system I am proud to have worked with my colleague and friend from Minnesota on this bill in a bipartisan manner and look forward to protecting the safety of the flying public With the creation of this task force this will be accomplished
812	Mr Speaker I rise in support of H R 346 the NOTAM Improvement Act of 2023 The FAA s Notice to Air System NOTAM which sends real time alerts to pilots about safety conditions experienced an outage with consequences so far reaching that it led to nearly more than 10 000 flight delays and more than 1 300 flight cancellations Even though the cause of the outage bore no connection to a cyberattack the breakdown in NOTAM alerts nonetheless raises concerns about the cyber vulnerabilities of the antiquated systems that underlie modern air travel At a time when cyberattacks are rising in both scope and sophistication modernizing the cybersecurity of air travel must be a priority for the Federal Government Mr Speaker 20th century air systems will no longer suffice in a world of 21st century cyber challenges That is why I wrote a letter calling upon both CISA and DOT to conduct a joint review of the cyber vulnerabilities of all aviation systems including NOTAM That is why I will proudly vote for bipartisan legislation requiring the FAA to establish a task force on NOTAM improvement
813	Mr Speaker as the ranking member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee I believe we have to do everything we can to ensure the U S remains the gold standard in aviation safety That is why I support H R 346 as amended and I urge my colleagues to do the same Mr Speaker I yield back the balance of my time
814	Mr Speaker in closing H R 346 as amended takes a very important step in ensuring that America s National Airspace System is going to remain intact remain operational and remain safe for the American people Again I thank Mr Stauber and Mr DeSaulnier for their work on this legislation It is a good bill and I urge all Members to support it Mr Speaker I yield back the balance of my time
815	Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume I rise in support of H R 399 better known as the Small Business Advocacy Improvements Act The SBA Office of Advocacy is charged with looking out for the interests of small businesses across the entirety of the Federal Government In many cases this means calling out the negative impacts of regulations that are hurting small businesses or looking for inefficient rules that are preventing small businesses from competing for government contracts This legislation expands the SBA Office of Advocacy s mission to include advocating for small businesses on international trade issues As our economy has become more and more intertwined with the rest of the world overseas markets have become more accessible for small businesses However when various regulations come out setting the rules of the road for trade agreements small business voices can easily be drowned out This bill solves this problem and ensures that Main Street America has someone fighting for their interests as international trade regulations are being created I thank my friend from Missouri for introducing this bill again in the 118th Congress and for always being a fierce advocate for our Nation s job creators Additionally I hope that as this Congress progresses we can continue to look for bipartisan ways to make the SBA Office of Advocacy more effective in helping our small businesses across the country Mr Speaker I reserve the balance of my time
816	Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr Speaker I rise in support of H R 399 the Small Business Advocacy Improvements Act of 2023 Let me begin by welcoming the new chairman of the Small Business Committee Mr Williams of Texas The committee has a long tradition of setting partisan differences aside and working together on behalf of America s small businesses I am glad we are off to a good start in the 118th Congress Today we are considering three bills that overwhelmingly passed the House in the last Congress As the chairwoman of the House Small Business Committee in the 117th Congress I worked closely with my colleagues on the committee and stakeholders to craft dozens of bills that will increase access to capital expand opportunities for free and low cost counseling and boost entrepreneurship The three bills we are considering today are a product of that hard work and I am hopeful that we will continue in the spirit of bipartisanship and focus on areas of agreement throughout the 118th Congress Turning to our first bill the Office of Advocacy was established in 1976 to be an independent voice for small businesses within the Federal Government and is tasked with representing the views of small businesses before Congress the White House and other Federal agencies To that end the office has regional advocates on the ground that provide outreach to small businesses local chambers of commerce and other associations to hear firsthand the concerns of small businesses The office works closely with Federal agencies to elevate these concerns throughout the rulemaking process Over the years their hard work has saved small businesses billions of dollars in regulatory costs while still accomplishing the important goals of the regulations However their charter does not specifically state that they have the authority to represent the views of small businesses before foreign governments and international entities H R 399 will simply clarify that the Office of Advocacy has the authority to examine international economic data and represent small businesses in international discussions particularly in trade negotiations I thank Chairman Williams Mr Luetkemeyer Mr Carter of Louisiana and Mr Mfume for their bipartisan work on this bill Mr Speaker I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill and I reserve the balance of my time
817	Mr Speaker I rise in support of my bill H R 399 the Small Business Advocacy Improvements Act of 2023 America s regulatory environment plays a huge role in the way small businesses operate They don t have access to the teams of lawyers needed to navigate the maze of government red tape that currently exists and they certainly don t have the resources to make their voices heard on the international stage This bill which is identical to the bill that passed the House in the 117th Congress gives small businesses that voice Specifically H R 399 gives the Small Business Administration s Office of Advocacy the authority to represent small business interests before foreign governments and international entities That representation is critical as the government renews and negotiates trade agreements and international commerce I thank my colleague Congressman Troy Carter from Louisiana for working with me in a bipartisan manner to improve the SBA s Office of Advocacy I thank Chairman Williams for helping bring this legislation forward and congratulate him on his new role as chairman of the Small Business Committee As a proven champion for Main Street America small businesses are in good hands with Chairman Williams at the helm Mr Speaker I recommend a yes vote on this bill that puts America s small businesses first
818	Mr Speaker I thank Representatives Luetkemeyer Carter and Mfume for their work on this bill that will give small businesses a strong voice in the international regulatory arena All too often small businesses views are drowned out by larger companies with sophisticated legal departments and armies of lobbyists SBA s Office of Advocacy works tirelessly to ensure that small business interests are heard at all levels of government Now that the world is more connected more and more small businesses are participating in the global economy Looking ahead they will need a strong voice advocating on their behalf in international discussions and trade negotiations The Office of Advocacy is ready willing and able to assume this responsibility Mr Speaker I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana Mr Carter
819	Mr Speaker I rise today to support the Small Business Advocacy Improvements Act Small businesses help make up the foundation of our country s economy with over half of Americans owning or working for small businesses As the driving force behind our economy it is crucial that the government uplift them at every possible point This bill clarifies the function and duties of the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration to allow the Office of Advocacy to represent the views and interests of small businesses before foreign governments and international entities This will allow American small businesses to be better represented in international markets and in negotiations with foreign entities Whether domestic or abroad our small businesses deserve a seat at the table if discussions are going to affect the bottom line My district is an international hub We have some of the most important and highest traffic ports in the United States Louisiana businesses connect with diverse companies and international markets across the globe every day This bill will ensure that small business owners have someone at the table fighting for them I will continue to do everything in my power to support American small businesses so they can better compete in the international market I thank our chair and Congressman Luetkemeyer for working with me on this important bipartisan bill Mr Speaker I urge my colleagues to support this measure
820	Mr Speaker I yield myself the balance of my time Mr Speaker small businesses are facing unprecedented economic headwinds From broken supply chains to rising interest rates many of these challenges are brand new for many businessowners I hope that we will be taking up meaningful legislation to help alleviate some of these large challenges but in the meantime we need to ensure small businesses have as many people fighting for them in Washington as possible H R 399 will allow Main Street to have one more voice looking out for their interests as trade regulations are being developed This has the potential to open up new markets and expand their reach into the global economy Mr Speaker I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation and I yield back the balance of my time
821	Mr Speaker I rise in support of H R 399 the Small Business Advocacy Improvements Act of 2023 which classifies the primary function and duties of the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration and for other purposes Specifically the bill would set requirements for the Small Business Administration to include research on how small firms contribute to the global economy H R 399 also requires the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration to represent the views and interests of small businesses before foreign governments and international entities to contribute to regulatory and trade initiatives that may affect small businesses According to the United States trade Representative small firms which account for two thirds of all new jobs in recent decades are the backbone of the American economy Small businesses make up 98 percent of all known U S exporters and indirectly support roughly four million jobs in local communities around the nation Residents in Houston take pride in their neighborhoods and places of business and when faced with hardships most notably Hurricane Harvey in 2017 they band together resilient and unwavering in their will to move forward Small businesses especially minority owned businesses face many challenges Nationwide women and minorities start businesses at a much higher rate than their white and or male counterparts despite facing disproportionate amounts of obstacles while establishing and maintaining their ventures By enabling more women and minorities to start small businesses we will see advancements in wealth and greater economic mobility According to a study by Next Street research shows that self employed business owners specifically minority women in Houston experience faster earning growth compared to employees who are compensated by salaries A study by the University of Georgia states that the buying power of African American Asian American and Native American consumers has increased over the past 30 years to 3 trillion in 2020 making up 17 2 percent of the nation s total buying power that year Based on data provided by the U S Census Bureau U S Bureau of Economic Analysis and other sources I strongly support the Small Businesses Advocacy Improvements Act because it allows women and minorities who own small companies to express their interests and opinions in the on the global market I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H R 399 because of the significant effects its passage will on millions of small business owners around the nation
822	Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr Speaker I rise in support of H R 449 the Microloan Transparency and Accountability Act When an entrepreneur wants to start a business finding starting capital can be one of the hardest challenges there is SBA s microloan program looks to solve this issue and provide capital to people who need help getting their businesses off the ground While this program is well intended Congress currently doesn t have access to some key metrics that we need to evaluate the effectiveness of this program For example it would be very helpful to have a comprehensive review of where the loans are being distributed to see if it is being utilized in many rural areas of the country Additionally we are currently left in the dark about the overall risk profile of the entirety of the program This bill would solve these problems by directing the SBA to do a comprehensive analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of this program The Microloan Transparency and Accountability Act will provide Congress with much needed insight to make determinations on how to better optimize this program to assist small businesses I thank my colleague from Tennessee who has advanced this bill for the last few Congresses for his dedication to improving this program Mr Speaker I reserve the balance of my time
823	Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr Speaker I rise in support of the bill before us today H R 449 the Microloan Transparency and Accountability Act which will improve SBA s data reporting with respect to the microloan program Congress created the microloan program in 1991 to make funds available to nonprofit community based lenders who in turn make small dollar loans to eligible borrowers Many of these borrowers are unable to get a traditional loan due to poor credit no credit history or a lack of business experience This program reaches various demographic groups that will otherwise not be served by the private sector or even the SBA s 7 a program especially businesses located in underserved communities In fact in fiscal year 2021 the program delivered more than 4 500 loans to small businesses in these communities totaling almost 75 million This fiscal year the SBA estimates it will assist over 5 700 small businesses supporting approximately 24 000 jobs The bill we are considering today will help Congress and the public better evaluate the program and its impact on underserved communities Despite the program s record of success many participating intermediaries report being restricted in their lending activity as a result of numerous rules governing the program being outdated The information received from these reports will assist Congress and the agency in developing policies to continue the strong performance of the program I applaud the bipartisanship shown by Mr Burchett and Mr Kim the sponsors of this bill Mr Speaker I urge all of my colleagues to vote yes and I reserve the balance of my time
824	Mr Speaker Mr Chairman Ranking Member Velazquez I believe I got that right I have been working on it for about 5 years it is a pleasure being here with you all Mr Chairman I appreciate the great work you do There is nobody I think better at the helm of the Small Business Committee than somebody who has actually taken a business and made it into something That is very American and very cool and I thank you for your friendship to me and my family Mr Speaker I rise today in support of H R 449 the Microloan Transparency and Accountability Act of 2023 The Small Business Administration s microloan program helps America s entrepreneurs access capital to help their small businesses grow These loans are usually around 13 000 13 000 the difference between them making it or not That kind of money would go a long way for a lot of our mom and pop stores in the rural areas of East Tennessee that I am proud to represent and in our inner cities as well Unfortunately the microloan program has a low participation rate Mr Speaker among our rural businesses My bill would increase transparency by requiring the Small Business Administration to report data about the program to Congress This will help us better understand how the program is operating and what we can do to improve it Government programs that support small businesses shouldn t be full of waste and they shouldn t neglect businesses simply because of their ZIP Code My bill will increase transparency and establish accountability at the Small Business Administration to ensure it is working on behalf the small businesses everywhere I thank my colleagues especially my sponsor across the aisle who has been my friend for a few years here for their support on this bipartisan commonsense bill which passed the House in the 116th and 117th Congresses and I look forward to seeing the Microloan Transparency and Accountability Act pass the House again today I also look forward to the Senate doing their work and taking this up Mr Speaker
825	Mr Speaker during the last Congress Mr Burchett and I introduced this important bill as part of a two bill microloan major impact package Together these bills would increase the number of microloan lenders in our communities increase access to capital and ensure greater transparency around how taxpayer dollars are being spent by the SBA I look forward to continuing to work with the chairman and the ranking member as well as Congressman Burchett to again advance these pieces of legislation Today I rise in support of the Microloan Transparency and Accountability Act and I look forward to working with them to advance the Microloan Improvement Act in the 118th Congress as well I have heard from a diverse range of businessowners across New Jersey s Third District about how just small increases in access to capital could make an enormous impact for them These businessowners aren t asking for the moon Many of them are in communities that are underserved and may not have a credit history extensive past business experience or the luxury of coming from wealth but they have a dream They are entrepreneurial and with a small investment a microloan to get started in some cases they can launch their business chase their dreams create jobs and transform communities By passing this bill we can help enhance microloans in rural areas and provide greater transparency to ensure we are using taxpayer dollars efficiently and effectively This bill will help make sure the SBA s microloan program is reaching those most in need best serving America s small businessowners and giving them a fair shot at success I thank Congressman Burchett for leading this effort and for the support of the Small Business Committee I urge all of my colleagues to support small businesses across this country and vote yes on this bill
826	Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume This bill will greatly increase the publicly available information about the microloan program s performance and impact If we intend to continue to support the smallest of small businesses especially women and minority owned businesses we need to make sure the programs targeting them are operating at their best That starts with improving the data and information available about where the loans are going how affordable they are and where the gaps in coverage are With more data Congress will be able to monitor the program and identify areas for improvement I thank the gentlemen from Tennessee and New Jersey for their hard work and collaboration in bringing this bill to the floor today I urge my colleagues to vote yes and I yield back the balance of my time
827	Mr Speaker the microloan program which delivers capital assistance to the Nation s smallest businesses is an important lending tool at the SBA H R 449 the Microloan Transparency and Accountability Act will deliver comprehensive data and information on the effectiveness of the program I applaud all of the members for working on this important legislation in an effort to shine more light on how well the program is working From my State of Texas to both of the Nation s coasts accessing capital remains a top challenge facing all small businesses We must ensure these programs and tools are operating at a high level and delivering on the goals that Congress set for them Mr Speaker I urge my colleagues to support H R 449 and I yield back the balance of my time
828	Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Small businesses are the engines of our economy Over half of the country s payroll is made from small businesses and when we work to find solutions to help these entities we are strengthening the economic foundation of our country So before we start debating these bills I thank our leadership team for recognizing the importance of small businesses and bringing these bills to the floor quickly so we can help build up Main Street America Mr Speaker I rise in support of H R 400 better known as the Investing in Main Street Act Last Congress the Subcommittee on Capital Access held a hearing on the small business investment company program otherwise known as the SBIC program During this hearing our members heard from witnesses about how this program attracts private equity investments to small businesses to hire more people and expand their operations This is a self sustaining program that supports our Nation s job creators without costing taxpayers any money In order to expand on this success H R 400 looks to increase the maximum allowable investments by SBICs from 5 percent to 15 percent of their excess capital to small businesses This change will allow for greater amounts of private equity dollars to go toward small businesses Additionally this will align the SBIC program to other financial regulations coming out of the OCC and will help jumpstart growth of small businesses across this country As we look for ways to continually improve on this program this change will have an immediate impact for our jobs and our Nation s job creators I thank my colleagues from California and New York for once again introducing this bipartisan solution to expand successful programs that empower the private sector to invest in small businesses Mr Speaker I reserve the balance of my time
829	Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr Speaker I rise in support of the bill before us today H R 400 the Investing in Main Street Act of 2023 The SBA s Small Business Investment Company program is a multi billion dollar investment program designed to bridge the gap between a small business owner s need for capital and traditional sources of financing It achieves this purpose by partnering private and public investments in early stage startup businesses It also gives America s small high growth companies an opportunity to fund and grow their innovative ideas and create jobs The success of this program can be seen with companies like Apple Intel and FedEx which all received early stage financing from the SBICs In fiscal year 2021 the combined private capital and SBA backed funds totaled 34 billion which was the highest in program history and helped support more than 126 000 jobs The number of financings to women owned minority owned and veteran owned small businesses increased by 36 percent Yet we can do more to ensure the program continues to meet demand The Investing in Main Street Act introduced by my colleagues Representatives Chu and Garbarino will strengthen and grow the SBIC program by allowing banks and Federal savings associations to invest up to 15 percent of their capital and surplus into SBICs This change brings the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 in line with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency s national bank charter percentage requirements It will increase the investment capital available to SBICs and allow them to invest more in small businesses I applaud Representatives Chu and Garbarino s continued work on this issue and this bill and I ask all my colleagues to support this bill Mr Speaker I reserve the balance of my time
830	Mr Speaker I am pleased to rise today to share my support for H R 400 the Investing in Main Street Act of 2023 a bill which I am proud to co lead with Congresswoman Judy Chu I also thank the chairman and the ranking member for bringing this up today We often talk about small businesses being the backbone of the U S economy It is not just a talking point but a statement of fact Small businesses are major contributors to our Nation s overall prosperity and in my district on Long Island small businesses are what fuels local economic growth As we face economic uncertainty due to inflation labor shortages and other ongoing challenges we look to our small businesses to be leaders in the private sector and to help revitalize our communities For over 60 years the SBIC program has injected capital into small businesses by allowing financial institutions or Federal savings associations to invest in SBICs up to 5 percent But times change programs need updating and now more than ever small businesses need access to additional capital The increase from 5 percent to 15 percent stipulated in this bill is a necessary reform that will help small businesses get back on their feet I thank my colleague Congresswoman Chu for her leadership on this issue and I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this bill
831	Mr Speaker I rise in strong support of my bill H R 400 the Investing in Main Street Act which would make commonsense changes to the small business investing laws to maximize the amount that banks may invest in SBA certified small business investment companies or SBICs Even though banking rules allow financial institutions to invest up to 15 percent of their capital and surplus in SBICs small business investing rules cap these same investments far lower at just 5 percent The Investing in Main Street Act simply fixes this outdated inconsistency to allow banks to invest the full 15 percent in SBICs Raising this cap will dramatically increase the amount of investment capital available to our country s small businesses for whom even small investments can mean so much Already SBICs have helped companies like Costco Apple and Intel get off the ground back when they were just starting out and SBICs fill a gap in the investment ecosystem and level the playing field for the smallest businesses which often face the highest barriers to securing investments from traditional private investors The nearly 300 certified SBICs in operation today have invested or committed 38 billion in small businesses nationwide and last year alone SBICs provided 7 9 billion in funding to over 1 200 small businesses and startups By raising the investment cap from 5 percent to 15 percent we could potentially triple those numbers in the years to come The growth will be especially important as America s entrepreneurship rates continue to soar as we emerge from the COVID 19 pandemic I thank Representative Garbarino for his partnership on this legislation and Chairman Williams and Ranking Member Velazquez for their strong support I urge a yes vote on this bill
832	Mr Speaker I thank the ranking member of the Small Business Committee for astute work on issues dealing with small businesses Mr Williams a colleague from Texas and the bipartisan sponsors of this legislation I have always said that small businesses are the backbone of the economic engine of America so I rise in support of H R 400 the Investing in Main Street Act of 2023 for the wiseness of providing more investment in small businesses As a strong supporter of small businesses I believe that this bill will improve the livelihood of many small businesses that have continuously been impacted by the COVID 19 pandemic The bill is designed to release more capital investment into small businesses in America If my colleagues have interacted with the small business community that is one of the number one issues that they raise consistently The bill would allow certain banks and savings associations to invest more into small business investment companies by increasing the statutory cap from 5 percent to 15 percent I can t even imagine the number 5 percent and the growing amount of small businesses and the ones that really stayed the course in desperate times which was COVID 19 According to the U S Bureau of Labor Statistics 2020 had the highest total number of applications for new businesses by far compared to all other years From 2019 to 2021 there was a 20 percent increase in the number of small businesses The Kauffman Foundation says that the highest amount was among Blacks Latinos and immigrants People know that small businesses allow them to create jobs in their own neighborhoods and to build future conglomerates but obviously small businesses reported negative impacts due to COVID It is important for this bill to become law immediately Pass it in the Senate and ensure that we have the opportunity to keep our small businesses from closing When small businesses have ideas we need to be able to give them the investment to focus on The Biden Harris administration has laid the foundation and has helped create the conditions for businesses and job creation We have had increasing job creation every month but we do know that cities like New Orleans and Honolulu have seen the highest rate of small business closures Other cities are right behind The fact that we can have a Small Business Administration that reforms and works with the Paycheck Protection Program to improve that if we had another circumstance like that that held up some of our small businesses this investment is going to be a lifeline I am delighted to rise to support this legislation because again as I opened my remarks small businesses are the economic engine of America and give women minorities and others the opportunity to build an economic engine Mr Speaker I rise in support of H R 400 the Investing in Main Street Act of 2023 to amend the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to increase the amount that may be invested in small business investment companies As a strong supporter of small businesses I believe that this bill will improve the livelihood of many small businesses that have continuously been impacted by the COVID 19 pandemic This bill is designed to release more capital investment into small businesses in America The bill would allow certain banks and savings associations to invest more into small business investment companies by increasing the statutory cap from 5 percent to 15 percent During the COVID 19 pandemic the United States saw a significant rise in small businesses According to the U S Bureau of Labor Statistics 2020 had the highest total number of applications for new businesses by far compared to all years that data was available From 2019 to 2021 there was a 20 percent increase in the number of small businesses created That is more than double the average growth rate year to year According to the Kauffman Foundation the increase in the rate of entrepreneurship during the pandemic was highest amongst Blacks Latinos and immigrants Even though there has been a significant rise in the number of small businesses during the pandemic many businesses report negative impacts due to COVID In April 2020 the U S Census Bureau launched the Small Business Pulse Survey to produce data in real time on the challenges small businesses were facing due to the pandemic When the first survey was collected in April of 2020 90 percent of businesses surveyed stated that the pandemic had a negative effect on business When the last survey was collected in April of 2022 70 percent of businesses surveyed stated that the pandemic had a negative effect on business Almost three years into the pandemic small businesses are still struggling with getting back on their feet Cities such as New Orleans and Honolulu had some of the highest rates of small business closures in the country because their economies are largely built around serving visitors In large cities like San Francisco and Austin the food industry was largely impacted because those who would typically eat out on their lunch break were now working from home The time for small business recovery is now The Biden Harris administration has laid the foundation and has helped create the conditions for business and job creation With the evolution of almost 5 4 million small businesses in 2021 we must work to maintain and support these growing businesses The Biden Harris administration partnered with the Small Business Administration SBA to reform the Paycheck Protection Program PPP The policy changes targeted small business and companies that were left out of previous relief efforts The data shows that these PPP policy changes provided more support in minority communities than the rounds under the previous administration The Small Business Relief under the American Rescue Plan included targeted grant relief and tax credits for small businesses hit by the pandemic The Small Business Relief produced immediate relief to more than 600 000 of the hardest hit small businesses The Biden Harris administration was able to provide more than 6 million small businesses with 450 billion in emergency relief via the Small Business Administration Investing more in our small businesses has had a profound impact on the job market in the United States In the first three quarters of 2021 small businesses with 50 employees or less created almost 2 million jobs in the United States the fastest start to small business job growth in any year on record Investing in main street should continue to be a priority for Congress Through this bipartisan bill certain financial institutions would have the ability to invest more into small business investment companies by raising the statutory cap I urge my colleagues to join me and support this important legislation that will expand access to capital increase the number of small businesses and create jobs at home We must show the American public that improving the economy is a priority in Congress This bill is a good first step at doing so
833	Mr Speaker I yield myself the balance of my time Mr Speaker the SBIC program fills the gap between the availability of venture and private equity capital and the needs of small businesses in startup and growth situations For decades this program has channeled capital to leading edge high growth companies Without it some of the Nation s most successful corporations would not be the companies they are today H R 400 raises the investment cap for banks and Federal savings associations from 5 percent to 15 percent This will lead to significant small business investment by SBICs which will result in economic growth in our local communities and job creation I applaud Ms Chu and Mr Garbarino for their bipartisan work on this bill Mr Speaker I encourage all of my colleagues to vote yes and I yield back the balance of my time
834	Mr Speaker I yield myself the balance of my time Mr Speaker the SBIC program has delivered for small businesses for many years It is time we update the program to match other Federal rules and ensure the program continues to serve our communities in the future This is a commonsense step to increase the amount of investment that an SBIC can receive Mr Speaker I urge my colleagues to support H R 400 and I yield back the balance of my time
835	Mr Speaker I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution H Con Res 7 commending the bravery courage and resolve of the women and men of Iran demonstrating in more than 133 cities and risking their safety to speak out against the Iranian regime s human rights abuses as amended
836	Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr Speaker today we consider an urgent bipartisan concurrent resolution condemning the Iranian regime for its gross human rights abuses against protesters in Iran who are bravely speaking out and standing up to this terrorist regime after being brutally silenced for two generations I thank my Democratic co lead Mr Gottheimer and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair McCaul for their support of this resolution While I was disappointed we were not able to get this resolution to the floor last Congress when I partnered with former Congressman Malinowski I am grateful that this resolution is now being brought up for a vote so quickly in our new Congress and with such broad bipartisan support Whether it be China Iran or Russia this new House Republican majority is ready and willing to stand up to our adversaries and protect America s vitally important national security interests Since the death of 22 year old Mahsa Amini while in the custody of Iran s religious police in September of last year the Iranian people have boldly taken to the streets to demand justice Now almost 4 1 2 months later Iranian men women and children continue to protest the regime and its cruelty despite the immense risk to themselves and their families They are literally risking their lives for a just cause greater than themselves These demonstrations are the most significant popular protests against the brutal regime s authoritarian rule since it came to power in 1979 The response from the regime has been vicious violent and vindictive not surprisingly Hundreds of protesters have been murdered by regime security forces Thousands more have been detained on trumped up charges Many of those in custody especially women have been subject to cruel and inhumane torture The regime has unjustly executed Iranian protesters in sham trials that lack any modicum of due process Many dozens more face the imminent possibility of execution The brave Iranian people are not backing down In fact they are more resolved than ever They are demanding a government that respects their rights at home stops funding terrorism abroad and makes peace with its neighbors They are demanding a future built on freedom justice the rule of law and a chance at prosperity It is vital that we the U S Representatives a body that is among the greatest symbols of freedom and democracy around the world stand with one voice to affirm our support for the brave Iranian people The resolution we are considering today does just this It reaffirms our resounding support for the brave Iranians who continue to put their lives on the line to secure their fundamental rights and freedoms The resolution is a call to action It urges the Biden administration to do more Instead of negotiating with this brutal regime at a moment of weakness and true vulnerability the Biden administration must meet the moment and do everything in its power to stand with the Iranian people It must sanction those responsible for these brutal killings It must do everything it can to counter the Iranian regime s cowardly attempts to restrict internet access that prevents its citizens from sharing images and videos and communicating with the outside world We have the power to give the Iranian people the voice they need to tell the truth about their oppression at the hands of the Ayatollah and we must exercise it Finally the Biden administration must lead the effort to press our allies and partners around the world to designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps uses terror to silence Iranian citizens at home and targets innocent citizens abroad The United States rightly designated the group a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 2019 Now the rest of the world must join in this noble cause The IRGC s reign of terror must come to an end Mr Speaker this resolution says loudly clearly and with a strong bipartisan voice that the American people are on the side of the courageous Iranian people The U S House of Representatives condemns in the strongest possible terms the regime s horrific violence Finally as we recognize the bravery of the protesters in Iran I also want to take a moment to remember that we have American citizens being held hostage in Iran today These innocent American citizens have endured years of false allegations wretched conditions and separation from their loved ones simply because they are Americans They must all be released No American can be left behind Mr Speaker I thank the 60 Members who have cosponsored this resolution and I urge the entire House to support its passage Mr Speaker I reserve the balance of my time
837	Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr Speaker I rise in strong support of this resolution Let me first thank Representative Tenney and former Representative Malinowski for their hard work on this bill We wanted so much to get it done in the last Congress but it is important that it is one of the first things that we get done in the 118th Congress Mr Speaker last year the world held their breath as Iranian women took to the streets protesting the devastating murder of 22 year old Mahsa Amini who was detained for allegedly violating the Islamic Republic s strict dress code The world thought maybe just maybe the regime would be ushered by their own people into the dustbin of history The protests quickly escalated into calls for the overthrow of Iran s theocracy and posed one of the most serious challenges to the ruling clerics since the 1979 revolution that brought them to power Although today the protests have slowed some and the regime remains firmly in place something has changed The Iranian people have a new understanding of their power Despite bullets despite arrests and the threat of execution they have persisted Cracks have been formed within the Iranian leadership elite The regime is not willing to meet the people s demands and the people are not willing to accept the status quo forever This is going to be a long drawn out domestic conflict The Supreme Leader is a corrupt old man who has stolen from and killed his own people for decades The Iranian people know it The Iranian President has not delivered on any of his promises and has left the Iranian economy in tatters through mismanagement corruption and international pressure And guess what The Iranian people know it It will not be instant and it will not be easy but change will come Brighter days await the Iranian people The Iranian people and also this regime know it is only a matter of time This resolution commends the bravery the courage and the resolve of the women and men of Iran who have participated in the protests to defend their human rights their dignity at the risk of their own safety to speak out against the horrific abuses committed by the Iranian regime It asks the Biden administration to continue its important work to support the people of Iran as well as encourages the private sector to do even more to help Iranians to communicate with one another in a safe manner Also this resolution before us today sends a clear message to the Iranian people that we in the United States Congress and the millions of Americans that we represent stand with them in their time of struggle for freedom We want the Iranian people to know that we see you We know the risk you are taking and the danger that you face Stay strong Stay strong as freedom will always win over tyranny Mr Speaker we want the Iranian people to hear our voices We want the world to hear our voices that the United States of America in a bipartisan way I know it is bicameral and people all across this country stand with those brave people It reminds me of struggles of others when they had to fight for their freedom in the streets Freedom will come in the morning because the voices of the people cannot be deterred Mr Speaker I reserve the balance of my time
838	Mr Speaker I thank my dear friend and colleague Ms Tenney for yielding and for her leadership on this issue Mr Speaker I rise in strong support of H Con Res 7 Today the United States House of Representatives stands up for human rights for the same freedoms that we as Americans hold so near and dear in our own country and against the brutal regime in Iran The Iranian Government has a long track record of vile human rights abuses Notably they are the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world not just against the United States but also against countries such as our own democratic ally in the Middle East Israel In September the senseless murder of 22 year old Mahsa Amini at the hands of the so called morality police for wearing her hijab improperly once again put the regime s human rights record front and center for the world to see Now as the Iranian people protest in the streets of more than 133 cities across the country demanding basic human rights the regime s response is to crack down even harder Since the protests broke out in September more than 450 have been killed including 58 children At least another 18 000 were arrested This is reprehensible unacceptable and inexcusable No government should ever treat its people this way The United States must continue to support the Iranian people in their struggle for freedom The Biden administration should take a strong stand and end its quest for a new Iran nuclear deal Great American companies like Starlink should help bring much needed internet access to those protesting in the streets which will significantly increase their communication and information sharing That is why I am proud to stand here on the floor of the House of Representatives today and support H Con Res 7
839	Mr Speaker I rise today in strong support of the brave women and men in Iran who are risking their lives to speak out against the Iranian regime s human rights abuses Today marks 131 days of ongoing protests in Iran It has been 131 days since Mahsa Amini was laid to rest after being harassed arrested and ultimately killed by Iran s so called morality police for simply wearing her hijab incorrectly Since her murder the people of Iran women and men alike have taken to the streets in more than 133 cities across the country to demand their basic rights and freedoms be respected For nearly 19 weeks protesters have gone out into the streets making their voices heard and demanding to be treated with dignity But instead of listening the Iranian regime is brutally cracking down on its own citizens gunning down protesters arresting people en masse and resorting to torture and sexual violence Since the protests began human rights activists in Iran have reported that nearly 20 000 people have been detained and more than 500 people have been killed including children What is more the Iranian regime has also executed four protesters with many more being sentenced for crimes that carry the death penalty These brutal human rights abuses must stop immediately The international community must stand with the Iranian people and against this violent suppression The Iranian regime must stop supporting Russia s brutal invasion of Ukraine stop spreading terror across the region and start listening to its own people Today the House is coming together to condemn unequivocally the Iranian regime s brutality and to express support for the Iranian people Their bravery in the face of suffocating repression and increased impunity is inspiring the world and deserves our respect and strong support They must know America stands with them Mr Speaker I will end by applauding the Biden administration for working with our allies and our partners to hold the regime accountable for the human rights abuses by imposing sanctions on Iranian officials deemed responsible for the violent crackdown on peaceful protesters Mr Speaker I look forward to continuing our bipartisan work to advance the cause of human rights in Iran
840	Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr Speaker while I am pleased at the bipartisan support of this resolution I think it is important to reinforce that there can be no legitimacy or lifeline for this inhumane regime that means no sanctions relief or nuclear negotiations Just a few months ago the Biden administration was actively negotiating sanctions relief as part of a new nuclear deal with a regime that is detaining torturing and killing its own citizens Let me be clear Iran did not comply with the last nuclear deal Why would they comply with a new deal The only thing a new nuclear deal could accomplish is giving the autocratic regime more resources to attack its own people Mr Speaker I implore the Biden administration to not resume these foolhardy efforts We do not negotiate with terrorists and the Ayatollah and his regime are terrorists They use fear violence and intimidation to achieve political goals We must return to a position of firm pressure and strong resolve while enhancing our deterrence in the region Until this regime changes its behavior it must remain under pressure Mr Speaker I reserve the balance of my time
841	Mr Speaker I rise today as a proud cosponsor of H Con Res 7 a bipartisan resolution supporting the brave women and men peacefully protesting for their rights and freedom in Iran Fundamental human rights are under attack in Iran It has been nearly 4 months since the death of 22 year old Mahsa Amini in the custody of Iran s so called morality police for allegedly wearing her headscarf incorrectly Since then thousands of Iranians have peacefully protested the regime calling for their basic rights and freedoms to be respected Young women and girls have been horribly beaten for protesting a repressive authoritarian government that controls how they dress and act in public In response to these demonstrations Iran s security forces have reportedly used live ammunition and tear gas against the protesters and horrifically have killed more than 500 people including at least 70 children It is clear Iran has no problem sentencing their own people to death simply for joining demonstrations They are willing to do almost anything to maintain their grip and control The United States must stand unified against the oppressive Iranian regime and stand up for the Iranian people whose basic human rights are being violated The Iranian people deserve justice and accountability That is why I recently led a bipartisan letter with my friend and colleague Joe Wilson calling for the United Nations to take urgent action to hold Iran accountable for its human rights abuses Following our bipartisan effort I was glad that the U S and 43 other countries supported our call for a U N special session on Iran At that special session the U N Human Rights Council voted to establish an independent investigative mechanism into Iran s brutal use of force and grave human rights abuses Today the bipartisan resolution we are all voting on will also help shine a light on Iran s human rights abuses It makes clear that the United States stands with the people of Iran that we are watching closely and that all Iranians including young women and girls are entitled to the same human rights and fundamental freedoms of all people around the world Mr Speaker I am voting yes on this resolution today and I encourage all my colleagues to join with me
842	Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr Speaker I just wanted to point out that this is a bipartisan bill in which we are working together Just last week the Biden administration hit Iran with fresh new sanctions Not only did he do that individually as he has been doing throughout the world but he is bringing others together so that we can speak with one voice Of course the European Union was a part of it Of course he brought along other countries so that the world is speaking with one voice collectively keeping us together As things go on we are continually ratcheting it up so that the people of Iran can get their freedom In fact the only thing that was somewhat changed and was done in this bill is where it encouraged the private sector following the recent clarification by the Biden administration of sanction exemptions or communication technology to work with the Biden administration to ensure protesters and activists have access to tools needed to circumvent government surveillance and repression The only thing that was eased some so that we can make sure we are communicating and allowing the Iranian people to communicate with others as they protest is what is in this bill I think in a bipartisan way we agree with that Mr Speaker I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas Ms Jackson Lee
843	Mr Speaker I thank the ranking member and I thank Ms Tenney for her leadership on this legislation Mr Speaker I rise in the name of Iranian freedom Freedom now for Iran and the Iranian people This legislation is brave as it speaks clearly in a clear tone without fear for the courageous persons who have gone to the streets not regarding their life or the lives of their families I call them brave courageous resolved freedom fighters fighting for their very life This legislation is absolutely necessary and it is of course bipartisan I thank Mr Meeks for indicating the strength of the Biden administration and the sanctions that have been offered and the manner in which the Biden administration Democrats and Republicans have said to Iran No nonsense No nonsense and certainly no nuclear capacity Anything that we have to do to ensure that that does not happen should not be tabled But what should be tabled is the unbelievable brutal fighting and killing that has occurred against freedom loving people I have been a longtime fighter with the people of Iran who are here in the United States Iranian Americans have taken to the streets to be able to say No more We will stand with our brothers and sisters in Iran I have seen the various attacks that have resulted in mass killings I have seen the fight in Camp Ashraf in Iraq where there has been a large loss of life of people who have been fighting for freedom I went to the camp to see the devastation I have supported plans for democracy in Iran I understand that they need us to stand by them What a horrible and brutal scene that we have seen children falling dead mothers brothers fathers and uncles What about Mahsa Amini She was just 22 years old wanting her life to be before her seeking democracy and freedom She was a young bright woman with courage that was taken away viciously in an ugly attempt to show how domineering this regime is In the course of taking her away her life was snuffed out We don t know her last hours last days last minutes or last seconds We don t know how brutal it might have been how she might have cried out for someone to be able to be empathetic and sympathetic someone to understand that her life deserved an opportunity to live and yet this brutal regime continues to be without concern for anything that it does I want to say to all of the Iranian women men and children protesters who are leading the fight I say loudly and clearly that we are standing with you I support this legislation entirely and I want to continue the U S Iran friendship with those people who are fighting for freedom
844	Mr Speaker let me conclude my remarks by saying I support Iranian women struggling against dictatorship Let me continue to say that I want this relationship between the U S and Iran to continue with the Iranian people who are fighting for democracy I believe it is important that this legislation pass to show that America is a champion for global democracy I would like to also indicate that I look forward to organizing the Iranian women s struggle against dictators congressional caucus and I hope there will be many who will join us Let us keep our voices alive I rise again to support H Con Res 7 I thank the gentleman from New York for his leadership and I thank the sponsors of this legislation for their leadership Mr Speaker I rise in support of H Con Res 7 a resolution that commends the bravery courage and resolve of the women and men of Iran protesting and speaking out against the Iranian Regime s human rights abuses As a long time advocate and fighter for justice and equality I am inspired by the millions of Iranians that are putting their lives on the line day after day in hopes that one day they will live in a country that values justice freedom and the rule of law The U S Department of State cites Iran for a wide range of human rights violations among them injustices such as arbitrary arrest torture and unjust executions I remember the attack on Iranian refugees at Camp Ashraf by Iraqi soldiers on April 3 2011 Camp Ashraf was the home to more than 3 000 members of the People s Mojahedin Organization of Iran PMOI an opposition group against the Iranian regime I went to Camp Ashraf in solidarity and support of the democracy and freedom loving Iranian people and that support continues to this day In July 2019 I penned a letter to President Maryam Rajavi to commemorate the occasion of the Annual Gathering for a Free Iran and to extend my heartfelt congratulations on her election I expressed my support for her 10 Point Plan for the future of Iran which ensures freedom of parties and assembly an abolition of the death penalty a separation of church and state gender equality and several other promising policy positions that will thrust Iran into the future Under President Maryam Rajavi s leadership women have risen to hold pivotal positions in the Iranian Resistance Iranian women will be the engine for change in Iran The uprising in Iran started with the murder of Mahsa Amini a 22 year old woman arrested by morality police in Tehran on September 13 2022 for allegedly violating Iran s strict rules requiring women to cover their hair with a hijab or headscarf Since the day of Mahsa Amini s funeral women men and children have taken to the streets risking their lives for a free and democratic Iran It is estimated that since the start of the protests in September over 500 protesters have been killed and thousands more arrested To all the Iranian women men children and protestors who are leading the fight I say loud and clear that I stand with you America stands with you I am proud to support the women of Iran the youth and the brave men and women who are struggling to make these freedoms possible for the people of their nation Let us continue to foster U S Iran friendship and collaboration as we work together to advance the universal rights of all humans including basic respect for human rights and the rule of law The mountaintop of justice for women for men for children and for all Iran is on the horizon I will always champion global democracy stand against human rights violations and never shy away from speaking truth to power in the presence of oppression That is why I encourage my colleagues to work toward putting human rights at the center of America s diplomacy by supporting H Con Res 7 Together we will put an end to the indiscriminate violation of human rights in Iran
845	Mr Speaker I rise in support of the resolution Iran is the leading aggressor in the Middle East the leading state sponsor of terrorism in the world and a longstanding oppressor of its own people The Iranian regime which has repressed far too many for far too long has been shaken to the core by a revolution led by powerful women The women in Iran who are risking their lives in confronting a monstrous and murderous regime are among the most courageous freedom fighters in the world The United States must stand unequivocally with our Iranian sisters in their fearless fight for freedom On September 13 2021 Mahsa Amini was brutally beaten to death by Iran s Orwellian morality police merely for not wearing a head covering Out of the tragedy of Mahsa s murder came a spontaneous groundswell of thousands of Iranian women rising up for their freedom some removing their head coverings and cutting their hair as a poignant form of protest The revolution reminds us that the future of Iran does not belong to a regime whose malevolence and obsolescence have become too glaring to ignore Iran s future belongs to its people led by its fearless formidable female freedom fighters The vision of a free and democratic Iran is an unrealized dream whose time has come and whose realization is long overdue
846	Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume for the purpose of closing Mr Speaker H Con Res 7 commends the brave people the brave Iranian freedom fighters for their fight against the brutal Iranian regime and demonstrates that the United States commitment is with them standing with the men and women of Iran In the face of so many human rights abuses the Iranian people have remained strong I say to our Iranian friends Though change won t happen overnight continue to stand strong because the time of this regime will soon be up The international community recognizes and that is us pulling together all of the people of the United States and the international community around the world the bravery and the strength of the Iranian people in the fight for their human rights for their freedom from tyranny and for a better tomorrow We have got to keep our voices Dr King once said that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere We have got to stand together and that is what this resolution does It puts the regime on notice that its people are on the march because freedom cannot be denied So Mr Speaker I am sure that there will be a resounding voice by this United States Congress by passing this bill to say to the Iranian people who put everything on the line that we hear you we see you and we stand with you until you get your freedom Mr Speaker I yield back the balance of my time
847	Mr Speaker I yield myself the balance of my time to close Mr Speaker I thank Speaker McCarthy Majority Leader Scalise Whip Emmer and the new chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Mr McCaul for prioritizing this important resolution and bringing it to the floor The fact is that this resolution was brought to the floor so quickly this week because the House majority demonstrates the importance of this issue I want to thank Mr Meeks for his continued support and help in ushering through unanimous support for this resolution in the last Congress We are finally here getting it through and I am grateful to the gentleman for his leadership and also for being so supportive Again I thank Mr Gottheimer especially and Mr McCaul for cosponsoring this resolution with me and all the speakers and everyone who have spoken in support of this resolution It is important that we stand as a united voice against the Iranian regime and in support of the people of Iran I say to the people of Iran We commend your bravery we mourn your losses and the American people are with you as you stand up for freedom Mr Speaker I yield back the balance of my time

856	Mr. Speaker I rise today to address the recent attacks on African American culture in Florida Recently Florida Governor Ron DeSantis blocked a new advanced placement course on African American studies The course was inclusive of study of African American culture that included literature the arts politics science and even geography In addition it included discussions about the Black struggle in modern America Govern DeSantis said that the class lacks educational value because it includes other subjects and the theory of slave reparations Clearly Governor DeSantis believes education should reject any content that allows students to think for themselves and he wants Americans to think that nothing bad ever happened in American history That does not sound like education to me It sounds like indoctrination and it should not be welcome anywhere in America Wokeness on the Republican side has become a new word a code word Let s eradicate that position
857	Mr. Speaker today I rise in support of the brave Iranian protestors who are fighting against barbaric forces of immorality During his 1967 inaugural address as Governor of California Ronald Reagan said that Freedom is a fragile thing and it is never more than one generation away from extinction Iranian protestors have based this revolution on three principles women life and freedom all of which America has rightfully championed With a considerable population of Iranian Americans in New York s Third Congressional District let America serve as a Democratic beacon of light for the Iranian men and women who are fighting abroad I acknowledge Representative Tenney who introduced a House concurrent resolution commending the bravery of the men and women of Iran I declare with every bullet and with every act of violence imposed by the Iranian government comes a call for us to condemn their actions and urge the Biden administration to take far greater actions than mere sanctions to address the countless murders and examples of senseless brutality
858	This last Saturday night a shooter came into my hometown of Monterey Park California to a dance studio and killed 11 innocent people Today I rise to honor the memories of the 11 lives we lost Diana Tom Mymy Nhan Lilian Li Xiujuan Yu Hong Jian Muoi Ung Valentino Alvero Yu Lun Kao Chia Yau Wen Tau Yu Ming Ma I also wish for the speedy recovery for the nine who are injured many of whom are still in the hospital Lunar New Year is a time of celebration for the thriving Asian American community in my hometown Saturday s senseless murders pierced the peace and joy of our celebrations and tore a hole through our hearts This Lunar New Year was supposed to be a celebration of the Year of the Rabbit characterized by hopefulness and peace I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to keep hope alive and work together to make our country a peaceful one free from this kind of horrific violence Thank you for helping me honor the memories of those lost by observing a moment of silence
859	Mr. Speaker recently my home State of California has suffered from a series of devastating storms on the flood side of the equation We received at least 11 inches of rainfall and were hit by extreme flooding as a result Now in California unlike any other places we have a simultaneous flood emergency and drought emergency only in modern California Many people were forced to evacuate Twenty people lost their lives The damage was extensive but the real disaster is that we already know how to reduce the fallout from flood events If we built more water storage such as Sites Reservoir raising Shasta Dam et cetera we could store more of this rainfall that would not become floodwater rather than also allowing it to flush out to the ocean where we will need that water in a regular drought period for agriculture et cetera Storing water from these storms also allows us to weather our periodic droughts such as in San Luis Reservoir If we could run the pumps hard enough we could be filling that facility So again that removes water from a flood zone and puts it into a good place where we can use the water We get fatalities from these disasters they flood out roads they do destructive damage to infrastructure We need better evacuation routes for people We need to think ahead and plan for storage and for flood infrastructure instead of letting climate change and environmental issues stop it
860	Mr. Speaker I rise today to mark the 50th anniversary of Roe v Wade the historic Supreme Court decision that gave women legal access to abortion Now 50 years later an extreme MAGA Supreme Court has reversed Roe taking us to a new dark place in history and now Republicans are racing full steam ahead toward a nationwide abortion ban creating hardship and even death for pregnant women and prison for their doctors To that I say my my my People not politicians should have the freedom to control their own reproductive destinies On the 50th anniversary of Roe v Wade I rise to say that the American people want more freedom not less and that means the ability of each person to make the personal decision about their health their lives and their future
861	Mr. Speaker I would like to kick off our first Wednesday Special Order Hour of the year by extending my congratulations and warm wishes to all of our colleagues all the new Members all the Members who are returning here We have very very important work to do in the 118th Congress I want to thank our House Democrat counterparts as well for working with us to ensure a smooth transition from the minority to the majority It is an important part of our institution and we are grateful for how this has gone so far We should all be rooting for the success of this Congress obviously because when Congress succeeds everyone in our country benefits and so we have an important responsibility before us We are under no illusion that the governing in such a closely divided body over these divided times is going to be any easy task We know that We know what the challenges are But we are also under no illusion that Congress has been operating as it should be We think this can be done better and our endeavor here is to show everyone how This problem that we faced here has been around for a long time Look at just what happened in the last Congress We had trillions upon trillions of dollars in government spending which sent inflation soaring We had votes on immensely consequential complex 1 000 plus page bills sent to us just hours before we were called to vote upon them We had Congress steadily outsourcing its authority over to unelected bureaucrats in the executive agencies We had Members dial into congressional hearing literally from their bedrooms and their basements We had Members voting by proxy while they were on vacation abroad With the 118th Congress we are here to declare that those days are over The House is getting back to work We are ending remote voting and remote committee work in the House That is going to restore greater transparency and accountability in the legislative process I actually believe that when we restore in person work as this was designed to be done as the Founders intended as they drew it up it is going to have an added benefit because I believe it will help us rebuild comity and foster more civility in the House I am not going to belabor this point but I would just say at the end of last year Congress passed a 4 155 page bill We spent 1 7 trillion on that omni and I think it was one of the worst government funding bills in the history of Congress Instead of individual bills to fund each Federal agency one by one with a roll call vote and amendments and deliberation process we didn t have any of that We had all the agencies lumped together right before the end of the year deadline with dozens of unrelated policies attached to it I mean everything from electoral college changes to retirement changes cosmetics regulation healthcare policies salmon fishing and horse racing regulations all crammed in there together under the guise of a government funding bill The process for passing this bill was almost as ugly as the substance It was written behind closed doors I mean literally behind closed doors by a handful of people It was brought to the House for a vote before anybody could possibly read it much less debate or amend it Is there a single Member is there a single Member of this body who thinks that is the way we should conduct the people s business I don t think so So this should go without saying but if we are going to fund each government agency and make changes to those unregulated policies we should do it in regular order We should do it in the regular process It should require a full open debate in committee and on the floor with the opportunity to make amendments Republicans are committed to do this We are back in charge and that status quo that we have had here where there is no transparency no accountability outright disregard for regular order those days are over Campaign season is over The House has elected our Speaker and now it is time to get to work Mr. Speaker tonight with the remaining time that we have in our hour we reserved the time because we want to introduce the American people to some of the bright new Republican Members that have joined the body here They are going to discuss some of the problems that are currently facing our country They bring a fresh new perspective to this and their voices are very very important And we are also going to talk a little bit about the Republican vision for how we are going to address all of these crises We are in charge We are here ready to work and I am delighted to introduce a few of these key Members I would start first Mr. Speaker by yielding to the gentleman from east Texas Congressman Nathaniel Moran I will say just a moment before I yield him the time that we are neighboring districts I represent Northwest Louisiana and then right over the Texas border is my friend there He is replacing the great Louie Gohmert who has finally retired from Congress I will tell you just a quick bit about Nathaniel He is formerly a West Point student a graduate of Texas Tech University He has a B A in Russian language and area studies an MBA and a law degree He had a civil practice in the east Texas area focused primarily on business and commercial litigation and transaction work He served on the City Council in the city of Tyler Texas He was mayor pro tem and ultimately he was appointed the Smith County judge and he served in that capacity from 2016 until he was elected to Congress in 2022 The thing about a county judge in Texas is they are effectively the boss in that area They hold all the power They do all kinds of stuff They are not just a judge in a court they are like an administrator over the whole area and he did it so well What I love about him most is he is a family man who is dedicated to his faith and he is a patriot They have four children just like we do He represents a great area and we are delighted to have him Mr. Speaker I yield to the gentleman from Texas Mr Moran
862	I thank the gentleman from Louisiana Mr Johnson for this opportunity to speak Mr. Speaker I rise today to introduce myself and to re introduce the First District of Texas to this distinguished body the people s House For those of you that do not know the First District of Texas is made up of 17 counties in east and northeast Texas The people there are faith based they are family loving they are hardworking they are tough minded and they are service oriented individuals They use their independent spirits their patriotic hearts and their rugged hands to build a future centered around faith family and freedom There are simply no better people in this world than those who reside in Congressional District 1 in Texas and there are none more dedicated to seeing this world be a better place for our children and our grandchildren than my constituents The First District of Texas boasts a landscape of pine trees dogwoods roses azaleas pecan and peach orchards lakes and beauty beyond imagination Its economy is as diverse and strong as its people It is not just home to some of the best oil and gas operations in the world but it is home to innovative manufacturing world class healthcare top notch educational institutions farming and ranching operations food processing plants steel and pipe companies and so much more You name it our folks do it and they do it with a spirit of excellence innovation and service toward one another The people in east Texas know that liberty gives rise to prosperity but prosperity should always give rise to generosity In east Texas the people love their God their families and their Nation and they are willing to sacrifice all for those things That is why we have so many veterans in our community East Texas is filled with individuals who out of reverence and respect for the most important things in life still stand for the national anthem and bow at their church altar They know how to stand firm for their principles and to ask for forgiveness when they make mistakes To be sure they know that strength and humility are not mutually exclusive rather they are values that support and build on one another I am so proud and humbled to represent Texas First Congressional District in the United States House of Representatives When I was just shy of 2 years old my parents moved me and my three older brothers from Arizona to east Texas in Southern Smith County and they worked with other families in that area to start a Bible college For almost a decade I lived on that Bible college campus and spent most of my time either going to church or exploring the woods and the county roads that surrounded our little single wide trailer From climbing trees to shooting snakes drinking the nectar of honeysuckles along the roadside playing football with the neighborhood kids or recovering from multiple broken bones from all the adventures we had living in the country several things became clear to me from my upbringing Among them I learned first that Almighty God has a call for each of us in this life that we were created for a divine purpose I learned that each of us have equal and eternal value I learned also that the great commandment in Matthew 22 of loving God and loving others should guide our every decision and action in life I learned simply that we are all sinners in need of a savior and I learned that these United States form the greatest Nation that has ever existed and our Republic is great because of the breadth of the freedoms offered here which come only from heaven above I am proud to be the first graduate of Whitehouse High School to serve as a Member of Congress and I am deeply thankful that my calling in life has led me to this place to this floor where I hope to fan the flames of liberty and to create more opportunities for my children my four children and for the children of every family in east Texas and beyond As a city councilmember in Tyler I learned quickly that sound policy is so much more important than soundbites Those 4 years on the city council solidified my desire to serve my community in whatever way possible Whether as a Sunday school teacher a church deacon a trombone player in the worship band Cub Scout den leader assistant Scoutmaster for the Boy Scouts or coach for my daughters basketball teams or simply just a volunteer for nonprofits across the community I discovered that giving is so much better than receiving I am blessed with a loving wife and four children two boys and two girls from high school down to kindergarten and they are a primary motivator for me to fix what is so wrong with this country I want my kids to grow and to know a country where freedom reigns supreme where government is limited and where their good decisions can lead to good consequences but equally as important where their bad decisions can lead to bad consequences so they can learn from their mistakes The road ahead for America will not be easy As a country we must make tough decisions to reverse our current trajectory If we make these good decisions we will see good consequences But if we fail in that task in that mission the consequences will get more dire and the future will become more bleak In fulfilling our mission we should never compromise our principles but we can be both principled conservatives and pragmatic policymakers As a county judge in one of the most conservative counties in the State of Texas I was proud to maintain one of the lowest tax rates in the State while still addressing critical areas of county government like improving roads and bridges supporting law enforcement working to improve election integrity and addressing longstanding facility needs It is possible to do both to keep the burden of taxes low while still addressing the critical needs of this country but it takes the wisdom to see the right path forward and the courage to take it In short it means channeling the greatness of the character of this country the type of bold and strong character evident in the people of the First Congressional District in east Texas and in so many other places in this great country I thank my constituents for this opportunity to serve to be strong and courageous for them and for this country and to work with all my might to preserve protect and defend this Constitution and the United States of America I pledge to do just that and to do all that I can to make that happen
863	Mr. Speaker I thank the gentleman from Texas Texas is well represented and the First District certainly is Mr. Speaker I am delighted to introduce next for his first Special Order hour speech one of the bright lights in the new incoming class in the 118th Congress Representative Mike Lawler from New York He represents the 17th Congressional District there which includes Rockland County Putnam County and portions of Westchester and Dutchess Counties Before serving in the U S House he represented New York s 97th District in the State Assembly and served on really important committees there banks education housing He has a broad range of experience In the New York State Assembly this is a neat statistic he passed more bills than any other member of his conference It really is a testament to his ability to work in a bipartisan pragmatic fashion to approach the problems that we face That is a skill that is going to come in handy here He previously served as a deputy town supervisor and as a senior adviser to a county executive He was also the executive director of the State Republican Party in New York that is no small task and did a great job there He graduated from Manhattan College with degrees in accounting and finance He was the valedictorian there I would note but his greatest accomplishment of course is his wife and daughter They live in Pearl River We are delighted to have Congressman Mike Lawler here Mr. Speaker I yield to the gentleman from New York Mr Lawler
864	Mr. Speaker I thank my good friend from Louisiana for the kind words and gracious introduction Mr. Speaker I rise today to talk with respect to School Choice Week here in the United States and to address the dire need for education reform across our country As a child I attended public schools In New York we have some truly phenomenal public schools When I was in second grade I was among the youngest people in my class with a September birthday and my teacher an immigrant from Russia said to my parents that she felt it was important for me to be left back because I needed time to mature and grow My parents were open to the idea so long as she was my teacher again and at the time that was not the program They would give you another teacher within the grade So my parents pushed until the school acquiesced and allowed her to teach me a second time It was the best thing that ever happened to me because it gave me the opportunity to grow to mature to develop I went from being one of the youngest in my class to the oldest in my class and that had a profound impact on me As my colleague pointed out when I graduated college I graduated as the valedictorian of my class I don t say that as a bragging point I say it as the result the direct impact that that moment had on my life from an education standpoint As I think about education and the impact that it has on our communities and our children I believe in school choice I believe not only in the right of parents to choose what education is best for their child but in the right of a child to get the education that will put them on a path to success in their careers an education that will accentuate their skills and their talents Whether that is a public school education or a private school education a charter school or a vocational school those options must be available to every child No child should ever be victim to a poor education because of their parent s wealth or their ZIP Code Too often we see that children are left in substandard schools because of politics and it is wrong As I mentioned I am a product of public schools My sister in law is a special education teacher in the very district that I graduated from She is part of the teachers union I respect and admire our teachers across America who provide a valuable education to our children but we must ensure number one that every child has access to a quality education and number two that parents not bureaucrats certainly not the teachers union have a say over their child s education As we recognize School Choice Week I think it is important to recognize the quality education that is provided in our public schools yes but also in our private schools our religious schools our parochial schools and yeshivas They provide an important education not just with respect to the basics of math science English and history but a religious foundation that plays such a pivotal role in a child s life We must recognize the role vocational schools play At a young age we should be helping children identify what their skills are what their talents are what their interests are so that they have a path to success Not everyone is meant to go to college College is a great thing As somebody who graduated at the top of my class I believe in a college education but it is not necessary for everyone In this country some of our most successful people don t have college degrees They went the route of a vocational school They own and operate their own business within the trades They employ hundreds if not thousands of people They contribute greatly to our economy and communities For me as we move forward we need to continue to invest critical resources in education at the Federal level at the State level and at the local level We need to protect local control of schools and we need to protect the rights of parents when it comes to their child s education All of this is so critical as we move forward to ensure that our children have a bright future and that they are productive and contributing members of our society Education is the civil rights issue of our generation It is so critical to ensure that every child receives the quality education they are entitled to When we look at what has happened over the last few years especially with the COVID 19 pandemic where so many schools were shut down and children were forced to learn remotely we saw devastating impacts and irreparable harm put upon our children Nine year olds lost ground in math for the first time since the 1970s Scores in reading fell by the largest margin in more than 30 years The damage was not felt equally across all demographics Schools that remained open or were closed for a shorter duration did not see the same decline in student performance Unfortunately high poverty districts that went remote for a majority of the pandemic will need to spend nearly all of their Federal education aid just to recover from these losses Such disparities are not new and the COVID 19 pandemic has shone new light on issues that have been plaguing many communities for a long time Students in poor communities whether they are urban or rural tend to have lower test scores literacy rates and graduation rates than their peers Meanwhile the presence of alternatives to underperforming schools has been able to improve student outcomes substantially slashing the achievement gap In the two decades since school choice programs were enacted in Florida fourth grade reading performance rose 26 percent among African American students 27 percent among Hispanic students and 29 percent among students from low income households Similarly math performance rose 27 points among African American students 19 points among Hispanic students and 21 points among low income students In my State of New York charter schools have made a big difference in some of the same students that struggle According to 2019 test scores 63 percent of charter school students in grades three through eight passed the State math exam compared to 46 percent for traditional public school students Additionally 57 percent of charter school students in the same grade levels were proficient in English language arts while the percentage for traditional public school students was 47 percent Any discussion on education reform must include school choice and support for it and support for our vocational schools parochial schools traditional private schools and charter schools We have to have an all of the above approach We need to empower communities parents and students as well as our educators to ensure that every child gets the education they deserve
865	Mr. Speaker I thank my friend from New York School choice is such an important issue I love what he said Education is the civil rights issue of our time So well said Mr. Speaker there is a theme here tonight We brought in incoming Members of the freshman class of the 118th Congress from the largest States I think It is not just a coincidence that we chose them for that duty tonight We have had Texas and New York and we will go to Florida next I am delighted to introduce a new Member from there Representative Cory Mills I will tell you just a little bit about him He is a decorated U S Army combat veteran and recipient of the Bronze Star He left his home State of Florida to serve his country in uniform and then served further our U S State Department and other government agencies in both Afghanistan and Iraq In fact he served with the 82nd Airborne Division and was a member of the Joint Special Operations Command Combined Joint Task Force 20 in Iraq He spent significant time there 7 years of service in Iraq and approximately 2 years in Afghanistan He served in the Kosovo campaign in 2000 He has traveled to the front lines of Ukraine during the Russian invasion to provide information for USAID and Department of State officials He is a busy guy President Trump appointed him to the Pentagon as a Department of Defense adviser and foreign policy expert With his wife I love that he in the private sector cofounded PACEM Solutions International LLC and PACEM Defense LLC We love that he is here with us because he is a husband and a father a patriot and a combat veteran an entrepreneur a foreign policy expert and a true American conservative We are going to have a lot of work for him to do Mr. Speaker I yield to the gentleman from Florida Mr Mills
866	Mr. Speaker today I want to introduce myself not just to the great people of Florida s Seventh District but to the rest of America While I may not be in your district and your exact Representative if you believe in our constitutionality if you believe in the rights liberties and freedoms in which American exceptionalism once excelled in then I will be your Representative I came from a very humble upbringing I grew up in a small town called Auburndale Florida in central Florida My mother and father both suffered from drug and substance issues They were in and out of prison nearly all of my life my father spent nearly 30 years my mother spent nearly 7 years I bounced house to house until I was finally adopted and taken in by my grandparents That is a very humbling experience for me not just because so many Americans today are suffering from these things but to also understand that I can hear your plight Also I understand the significant importance of being a nuclear family member My grandparents didn t have much My grandfather was a welder my grandmother used to do hair on the back patio for women in the community We lived on very little after my grandfather s disability But the one thing that we always had was our love our faith and this Nation I went on to serve in the 82nd Airborne and as a member of the Joint Special Operations Command to serve honorably in our Armed Forces and to be a Bronze Star recipient My socioeconomic status and how I was born into what family did not define who I am That is something very rare in this world That is something that only exists here in America I have been honored and blessed to create tremendous businesses with my wife where we have gone on to serve over 200 of our law enforcement departments SRT HRT the FDLE the Department of Corrections as well as for our members of the Armed Forces In my family we truly believe in the ideas of defend not defund our men and women in blue and that matters to us I would just add that as I stand here willing to serve yet again in a new uniform I want you to know that accountability transparency and accessibility to your Members should be a top priority That also means accountability for the wrongdoings of our Federal Government whether it is the overstepping of State s rights and individual rights and the violations of the 10th amendment or whether it is getting accountability for the wrongdoings of open borders a failed Afghan withdrawal and the America last policies that have threatened our energy independence Mr. Speaker I know something about these failed withdrawals When Congressman Ronny Jackson from Texas reached out to me he had a mother Miriam with three children a 15 year old boy an 11 year old little girl and a 2 year old little girl They were left behind in Afghanistan after the Biden administration chose to abandon Bagram Air Base to hand over to the Chinese that enabled over 40 000 Taliban Haqqani and ISIS Khorasan to be released from their detention centers but it also shut down the commercial flights that many Americans had planned on using to return home This mother and her three children only wanted to do one thing return back home to America When Ronny Jackson called the Department of Defense and the Department of State under this Biden administration they failed to answer the call That is why when he called me we put together a great team that went over and after 11 days and three failed attempts the Biden administration not only threatened to shoot down an aircraft of Americans which was a November aircraft that was there to save other Americans but he thwarted us in three other efforts The great thing about America is that we are not defined by the minority which is our Federal Government We are defined by the voice of the American people which is the majority that cannot be silenced That is why after 11 days multiple attempts and crossing into impermissible environments we were able to rescue and conduct the very first successful overland rescue of Americans out of Afghanistan and return that mother and her three children back and they finished out their school year Mr. Speaker the one thing I believe in is action While I take this time to speak before you today I want you to know that that is not what the American people are about politicians speaking but acting When it came to the 2020 riots we didn t sit back and ask to defend and dismantle our law enforcement My wife and I we stood strong as we donated hundreds of thousands of dollars and less lethal goods to defend our law enforcement our communities their businesses and their homes If I have learned nothing in my time in the military as a combat veteran as a businessowner as a foreign policy expert and as an American it is that it is time for action
867	Mr. Speaker I thank my friend and I thank him for his service to our country We are glad he is here Mr. Speaker we have many bright lights from Florida Another one that I would like to introduce next is Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna who is here to serve her first term She represents Florida s 13th Congressional District She is a member of the House Freedom Caucus and the Second Amendment Caucus and is already very busy here on the grounds She is the first Mexican American woman elected to the United States Congress to represent the big State of Florida She was raised by a single mother in one of southern California s low income neighborhoods She tells the story often that she experienced firsthand the devastating consequences of radical Big Government policies in cities like the one she grew up in It was a tough childhood She joined the military at a young age and she went on to graduate from the University of West Florida with a bachelor s degree in biology She served in the U S Air Force and that is where she met her husband Andy who is a Bronze Star recipient who earned a Purple Heart when enemy combatants shot at him in Afghanistan She brings an extraordinary work ethic and an inspiring life story and her fresh perspective to our Republican Conference We are so happy to have her join our group here and our conservative cause Mr. Speaker I am delighted to yield to the gentlewoman from Florida Mrs Luna
868	Mr. Speaker I rise today to address the politicization of what is happening at our southern border against the American people Several years ago before politics was even a factor or thought for me I got involved as a counter trafficking activist During that time I had the honor and privilege of working next to some very brave people who were working to expose what was happening with the whole immigration debate One of the more alarming things that I found is the more that I addressed this issue the more that I got involved to really shed light on it to the American people the more that I was called a coconut the more the color of my skin became a topic of discussion and the more that the left sought to if anything underestimate and undermine my capability to address this topic because of the fact that I am a conservative Yes I am Hispanic Yes I am a veteran Yes I grew up and saw things that a lot of people probably in this very body haven t had to experience But what I am standing here today to say is What I have realized over that journey what I have realized over the past couple of years is that I thought that in politics some people would be here to do the right things and I found that it is actually the exact opposite I found that within this body people will lie to the American people about what is happening at our southern border not because they want to help people not because they actually care about these issues but because they simply seek power I think that we are seeing that today Only several years ago you could see some Members of the Democrat Party some people like former President Barack Obama say Don t come here you will get hurt in the process Yet the media seems to forget about that They say now that if you are a Republican if you embrace border security if you want to stand up for people that are being trafficked that you are a racist that you are xenophobic and they seek to label us It is simply not true I have been down to the border three times and I can tell you that on my last experience down there I went with a member of the Border Patrol Union his name is Art Del Cueto We went down to a portion of the border that was completely open It was on an Indian reservation What I saw and heard down there was alarming It was alarming for several reasons one mainly being that the media wasn t discussing it But also too one of the most horrifying stories that I heard was actually from him saying that on just regular walkie talkies that you could purchase at Walmart you could pick up the radio frequency of some of the coyotes working with the cartels to actually scout out women that were crossing illegally and they would be brought up to the top of these mountains and raped That was their right of passage they would say they would joke about it That is something that we should all be talking about We pride ourselves in this country being that we are a free country free of slavery Yet that is happening every single day We have the opportunity to fix it and we don t Why It is not because we can t fix it we can It is because of partisan politics That has to end In 2021 alone 147 000 unaccompanied minors were crossing along the U S Mexico border There is no question in my mind that these young people are absolutely exploited for entry and abuse of the asylum process that has been actively happening over the last couple of years especially under this administration The Coalition Against Trafficking in Women estimated that 60 percent of Latin American children caught by cartels are actually exploited for child pornography or drug trafficking purposes If we as a country cannot come together and address the simple issue of trafficking of modern day slavery of the exploitation of children minority children at that then are we any better than a Third World country or a place like China that engages in human rights abuses every single day I am tired of this I am sitting here willing to work with Members across the aisle but I don t see that olive branch because of the fact that I am a conservative Republican That is wrong and that is why I am standing here today I hope that we as a country can come together That this administration can accept responsibility for the absolutely inappropriate abuse of the media saying that they want to legalize everyone that is encouraging people to come here and people are hurt on both sides because of it Mr. Speaker if there are people willing to work with me I hope to work with them I hope to end this awful slavery that we are seeing every single day
869	Mr. Speaker I thank my friend That is such an important issue and we can t talk about it enough Thank you for drawing the Nation s attention to it tonight Mr. Speaker our final new Member that we wanted to introduce tonight comes from another big State and that is California I want to tell you a little bit about Representative Kevin Kiley He serves the people of California s Third District in the House He is from that district He was born there He attended the local public high school there His mom was a special education teacher I guess that inspired him because he began his career as a 10th grade English teacher at Manual Arts High School in inner city LA He chaired the English Department there He led his students to significant academic gains and he founded an award winning speech and debate team After graduating law school he helped prosecute the civil case against China s Huawei Technologies for intellectual property theft He defended the Constitution in California courts we have that in common We did a lot of that work in the courts before we came to Congress He became a prosecutor and he represented the people of the State of California against violent felons as a deputy attorney general He was first elected to the California State Assembly in 2016 and he did some significant work there in his tenure He introduced significant school choice legislation He authored ground breaking new laws and protections for sexual assault victims and privacy and criminal justice reform and freedom of speech In fact in 2020 he was named the National Legislator of the Year for that work for advancing economic freedom I could go on about his bio but I do want to mention this one little minor note He has a bachelor s degree from Harvard a law degree from Yale and a master s in secondary education from Loyola Marymount Clearly he is overqualified to serve in the U S Congress but we are glad he is here I think he brings a lot to this body and will be an extraordinary Member Mr. Speaker I yield to the gentleman from California Mr Kiley
870	Mr. Speaker I thank the gentleman for that kind introduction It is an honor to represent California s Third District Mr. Speaker I would like to raise an important issue regarding aid for my constituents harmed in the Caldor fire which I had the chance to discuss with President Biden yesterday The Caldor fire tore through El Dorado Alpine and Amador Counties in August of 2021 The community of Grizzly Flats was leveled and 800 homes were destroyed With 20 000 residents under mandatory evacuation orders further devastation was only narrowly avoided Americans may remember the surreal images of ski slopes set aflame smoke billowing from the foothills and ash raining down on cities across the Sacramento Valley Entire communities in the Lake Tahoe area had their survival hanging on a razor s edge and could well have been consumed by the flames if not for the heroics of our first responders By the time the blaze was extinguished it ranked among the most destructive fires in California s recorded history I had the chance to walk through the hollowed out streets and roads of Grizzly Flats just days after the fire To his credit President Biden visited the following month as well President Biden traveled to California in September of 2021 to survey the damage After landing at Mather Airport President Biden joined Governor Newsom California Office of Emergency Service Director Mark Ghilarducci and other State and Federal officials for an aerial tour of the smoldering remains of Grizzly Flats and the surrounding area After landing CAL OES Director Ghilarducci thanked President Biden for the relief that had been provided to victims of the recent Dixie and River fires and the relief that would soon be provided for victims of the Caldor fire At that point President Biden interjected He said We are going to take care of them there s a lot we can do and it starts off being a Federal responsibility in my view These are President Biden s words as he was present shortly after the fire We are going to take care of them there s a lot we can do and it starts off being a Federal responsibility in my view Yet well over 1 year later President Biden has yet to fulfill that promise and provide individual assistance through FEMA to hundreds of people hundreds of my constituents who lost everything In fact FEMA has twice denied individual assistance even though this same Federal aid was provided in similarly destructive wildfires such as the 2021 River fire Yesterday I spoke with President Biden I reminded him of his visit to Grizzly Flats and of the promise that he made The President was receptive and seemed genuinely troubled that the residents of Grizzly Flats have not received relief He said that he would get to the bottom of it and I thank him for that The reality is that the President has the power with the stroke of a pen to grant this aid to the residents of Grizzly Flats In fact just a few years ago President Trump did precisely that providing individual assistance to victims of another California fire the Creek fire So I am calling on President Biden to keep his word and to give victims of the Caldor fire the relief that they deserve Now while we must remember the debt that is owed to the community of Grizzly Flats we also need to reflect on how we got here The fact is that these catastrophic wildfires that ravage California year after year are not inevitable They are a direct result of failed policies and of neglect and Grizzly Flats is a perfect example The United States Forest Service actually had a fire mitigation plan that was announced in 2013 that would create a 15 000 acre fuel reduction buffer east and south of Grizzly Flats Now although that project began in 2014 and was scheduled to be completed by 2020 before the fire it became mired in delays and by the time of the fire in 2021 only 14 percent of the work had been done By the way the Forest Service exaggerated this They overstated the amount of work that had been done They claimed that it was twice that and it took an investigation by Capital Public Radio to reveal the truth Wildfire experts believe that if the project had been completed on schedule it could well have saved Grizzly Flats A key architect of the mitigation project former El Dorado National Forest District Director Duane Nelson said that if the project had been completed then there would have been a high probability that Grizzly Flats would not have burned in the Caldor fire He continued that it could have meant survival So even though the damage was caused in part by Federal negligence we still have not gotten Federal aid That is what makes this such a bitter pill to swallow for my constituents that it was neglect on the part of the Federal Government that led to the fire and then after the fire the promises of the Federal Government for relief have gone unfulfilled More broadly as we do everything we can to get assistance to the community of Grizzly Flats we need to do everything we can to assure that other communities don t suffer the same fate This means taking the simple and scientifically backed steps that we know reduce the risk of wildfires actively and responsibly managing Federal forests clearing underbrush and dead trees that serve as ladder fuels conducting controlled burns and selectively harvesting mature trees for logging to ensure healthy forest density Those are just the beginning of the steps that we can take to make sure that this doesn t keep happening again and again I am calling on all of us to work together across the aisle to take the steps to do the work that needs to be done In the meantime I am calling on the President to please today tomorrow as soon as he possibly can with the stroke of a pen make good on his promise and give the residents of Grizzly Flats the relief they deserve
871	Mr. Speaker I thank my friend California s Third District is well represented as everyone can see Mr. Speaker as is also obvious by the sample of new Members that we presented here tonight from New York Florida California and Texas this is an extraordinary class of Republican Members who have joined our conference here in the Congress We look forward to serving with them These will be fateful days for our country and there is much hard work ahead in the 118th Congress Mr. Speaker with that I yield back the balance of my time
872	Mr. Speaker I rise today to recognize a good friend and a wonderful professional Randy Sawyer Randy has been a dedicated public servant in the county I represent in San Francisco Bay Area Contra Costa Contra Costa is home to a heavily industrialized part of the bay area with refineries and chemical plants Randy has served important roles at the Contra Costa Health Services beginning as a specialist engineer in the Hazardous Materials Division then becoming the Chief Environmental Health and Hazardous Materials Officer and ultimately ending as the Deputy Director Among Randy s efforts to promote public health he helped to champion the county s community warning system one of the best response teams in the State and the country to alert county residents and businesses when they are impacted or in danger of being impacted by an emergency He also helped Contra Costa lead the county in refinery safety with his work on the industrial safety ordinance which I am proud to be an author of The legacy of Randy s work will continue to protect residents in the bay area for years to come Please join me in congratulating Randy on his retirement and honoring him for his 30 years of public service
873	I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today it stand adjourned until 10 a m Thursday January 26 that following the prayer and pledge the morning hour be deemed expired the Journal of proceedings be approved to date the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day and morning business be closed that upon the conclusion of morning business the Senate proceed to the consideration of the Klobuchar Grassley resolution as provided under the previous order
874	Mr. Speaker I have three requests for committees to meet during today s session of the Senate They have the approval of the Majority and Minority Leaders Pursuant to rule XXVI paragraph 5 a of the Standing Rules of the Senate the following committees are authorized to meet during today s session of the Senate
875	Mr President here on the floor yesterday I called on America s European allies including Germany to do more to equip Ukraine with long requested tanks not just to resist Russian aggression but to defeat it I have consistently called on the Biden administration to be more proactive and to lead by example in delivering lethal aid like the long range weapons with a greater sense of urgency I was happy to learn yesterday and this morning that indeed both the White House and their counterparts in Germany are finally moving forward with these overdue steps Germany has announced it will supply Ukraine with an initial 14 Leopard 2 tanks and the Biden administration is expected to send at least 30 M1 Abrams tanks as well Good news Now that Berlin has taken this step I hope and expect that Germany and other European countries with tanks in their inventory will move expeditiously to send them to Ukraine Modern main battle tanks will provide highly maneuverable armored firepower that will help Ukraine liberate territory and keep pressure on the Russian aggressors but as I have said repeatedly time is of the essence Of course as we rush these long overdue capabilities to Ukraine the West s work is far from over These drawdowns of Western arsenals must also prompt serious work to expand the capacity of our defense industrial base The Biden administration s efforts on this front are overdue but important and I hope more of our allies will follow through by moving quickly to put critical munitions and weapons systems under contract and expanding each of their industrial capacities
876	Mr President on another matter here are just a few scenes from across our country in the last few weeks Thirty people were shot in Chicago this past weekend alone That is up from 21 the weekend before In Philadelphia police are investigating a carjacking spree that is reportedly being carried out by armed juveniles They put a gun to my head and they took the van And I haven t found it back again Out in San Francisco just one neighborhood has seen a beating an attempted robbery a 2 year old suffering fentanyl poisoning after playing in the park and 17 car windows smashed all on one street all on one night Streets neighborhoods and cities across our country are being swamped literally swamped by a level of crime that is unsafe uncivilized and totally unacceptable My hometown of Louisville KY saw 10 homicides in just the first 10 days of 2023 and already 5 more since then the latest additions to the list of 500 plus homicides we have seen since the start of this violent crime wave 3 years ago As Louisville s mayor said a few weeks ago these are not just numbers these are people Many of the individuals our city lost were young just starting out their careers and families Far too many were children including a 14 year old boy we lost just 10 days ago Of course for every victim who lost their life to violent crime there are even more who have been injured or traumatized or literally forced to live in fear As one resident said I got to lock my doors all the time I m worried about my children going outside It s not fair It is not fair Of course he is absolutely right It is not fair that once safe neighborhoods have become war zones It is not fair that children are being murdered Or look at what is happening right here in the Nation s Capital Right here in Washington law and order have been in a free fall Over the weekend in broad daylight a rideshare driver had his car stolen by a group of men brandishing rifles City wide Washington is averaging a carjacking every day Homicides this year are up 17 percent Just yesterday two 18 year olds fresh off a carjacking spree in a nearby county came right here to the capital ran into two separate Capitol Police vehicles and then tried to flee on foot Fortunately the Capitol Police brought them into custody Yet the DC City Council is so completely captured by the woke far left they have responded to the crime wave with a new criminal code that listen to this reduces penalties even further That is the response of the DC City Council Just last week the council overrode the mayor s veto and pushed through a measure that shreds shreds the maximum punishment for gun crimes It eliminates almost all mandatory minimum sentences It will clog up the court system with massive expansions of new jury trials for misdemeanors Well the good news on this front is that the U S Congress gets to have the final word over reckless local policies from the DC government Senate Republicans will have a lot more to say on this subject Stay tuned The American people know crime is getting worse and they know it hasn t happened by accident From Los Angeles to Philadelphia to Chicago the Democratic Party has backed radical district attorneys who have tried to unilaterally take parts of the local criminal code offline They simply decline to prosecute serious crimes from drug possession to criminal threats as a matter of principle In some cases these woke prosecutors are seeking early release for felons convicted of violent crimes Many other Democrats have spent years fanning the dangerous flames of the far left s antipolice rhetoric Of course studies have proven that public hostility to police leads directly to more crime including more homicides in the at risk communities that need law and order the most Furthermore the Biden administration and Senate Democrats have spent 2 years working to stack the Federal judiciary with former public defenders and others whose sympathies lie more with criminal defendants than with innocent victims Nobody is arguing that criminal defenders should never become judges but this has been a dramatic deliberate transformation project that is skewed overwhelmingly in one direction Even the New York Times has admitted it has been a sea change in the world of traditional nominations The Biden administration never misses an opportunity to make crime even worse Deaths from cocaine have quintupled over the past decade but just a few weeks ago this President and his Attorney General took the radical and borderline lawless step of unilaterally reducing the penalties for dealing crack These liberals respond to soaring overdose fatalities by going even softer on drugs Democrats are struggling with the basics Actually this shouldn t be that hard Drugs belong off the streets Career criminals belong behind bars and far left politicians who put innocent citizens last belong far away from the levers of power I suggest the absence of a quorum
877	Mr President as the debate over raising the debt ceiling continues Leader McConnell said something yesterday that I think is right on the mark He said that when it comes to moving a debt ceiling proposal through Congress the House should go first He is correct Not only should the House go first but they must quickly show the American people what their plan actually is for avoiding a first ever default on the national debt So far we haven t heard anything beyond vague and troubling talking points about the need to cut Federal spending That is not going to fly when you are in the majority as Speaker McCarthy of course is The substance and details make all the difference The debt ceiling is not some political game and Speaker McCarthy has an obligation to level with the American people on what precisely the new House plans to do in order to avoid a default President Biden and the Speaker have reportedly agreed to sit down in the near future on this topic and the Speaker is apparently heralding this development as some sort of big win or concession But look Speaker McCarthy sitting down without a clear plan is no win Sitting down to talk about the debt ceiling without a plan is like coming to the table with no cards President Biden meanwhile has a plan He has cards He has been clear that there must be no brinksmanship and no default on the debt ceiling Speaker McCarthy what about you The House GOP is threatening spending cuts Well what are they why the evasion Why is your conference hiding from the American people House Republicans where are your cards Again I want to be clear that the debt ceiling is a subject of the highest consequence and using it as a bargaining chip using it as brinksmanship as hostage taking as Republicans are trying to do is exceedingly dangerous because if the House of Representatives continues on their current course and allows the United States to default on its debt obligations every single American is going to pay a terrible and expensive price The consequences of default are not some theoretical abstraction If default happens Americans will see the consequences in their daily lives Interest rates will go soaring on everything from credit cards and student loans to cars mortgages and more That is thousands of dollars for each American going right out the door That will happen and through no fault of their own Retirement plans like 401 k s would lose their value robbing people of their hard earned livelihoods For millions of Americans who one day dream of owning a home their own piece of the rock a default would add 130 000 to the lifetime cost of a new home Imagine spending years putting a little bit of your paycheck aside every month in order to buy a house only to find out that suddenly that dream is entirely out of reach because radical politicians in Washington bumbled their way into a financial catastrophe That is precisely the danger we approach thanks to the House GOP s reckless approach to the debt ceiling None of this need be inevitable or even likely if only House Republicans would quit their radical posturing and work with Democrats in a serious way to raise the debt ceiling together and we should do it soon not months from now when America finds itself staring straight into the abyss of a financial catastrophe I would remind my Republican colleagues they did it before when Trump was President three times with no Democratic obstruction or hostage taking and we did it once together when Biden was President Much of this debt comes from spending when Trump was President voted on by a Republican House and a Republican Senate So it is a bit of hypocrisy now to say that they can t do it again and are holding it hostage and are playing a dangerous form of brinksmanship It shouldn t matter who is President These are still bills we already incurred that must be paid for the good of all Americans
878	Mr President the new Congress is a chance for a fresh start and we need a fresh start We cannot afford a repeat of the past 2 years Despite the fact that Democrats controlled Congress by the slimmest of margins in the last Congress Democrats acted as if they had a mandate for radical far left change Democrats shoved through multiple partisan spending sprees including the so called American Rescue Plan Act which kicked off our current inflation crisis And what they got through was mild compared to what they wanted to push through from a Federal takeover of elections to some of the most extreme abortion legislation in the world Fortunately some of the Democrats most radical proposals didn t ultimately make it through Congress but not for a lack of trying on Democrats part Despite the fact that they had nothing more than a technical majority Democrats did their best to eliminate a voice for the minority party in the Senate by attacking the Senate filibuster rule Some contemplated packing the Supreme Court to secure judicial support for Democrat policy priorities And Democrats rhetoric was often as extreme and divisive as their policies with the standout example being an address the President gave a year ago this month in which he suggested that half the country was racist Mr President we have had another election and the American people rejected one party rule by electing a Republican House of Representatives They have created a situation in which both parties will have to work together to get anything done I hope this will mark a new less partisan moment here in Congress I hope we can move on from the past 2 years and start afresh to work together to address the challenges facing our country because there is a lot that we can do together Despite the partisanship of the Democrat agenda over the last 2 years there were still moments that reminded us that there are many areas where we can agree or are close enough to work together I introduced a number of bipartisan bills in the last Congress and I am looking forward to working with colleagues of both parties on a number of issues in the new Congress One major piece of legislation we take up every few years is the farm bill which has a strong bipartisan history During my time in the Senate I have introduced farm bill legislation with both Democratic and Republican colleagues and I think that working together we can produce a bill this year that will meet the needs of our Nation s farmers and ranchers and strengthen U S agriculture production Another obvious area for bipartisan cooperation is the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization that is coming due this year and none too soon as recent air travel fiascos have made clear Our last FAA reauthorization bill was a strongly bipartisan piece of legislation and this year s bill should be the same Another area where I think there is a lot of room for bipartisan cooperation is promoting transparency and accountability in Big Tech President Biden recently published an op ed in the Wall Street Journal calling for among other things section 230 reform I already have bipartisan legislation with Senator Schatz to reform section 230 and increase transparency and due process for users around content moderation actions taken by Big Tech platforms and I will work to advance that legislation in this Congress I also think there is a lot we can do on a bipartisan basis to advance trade agreements to expand markets for American products and services around the world The Biden administration has been slow to take action on trade and I think there is a real interest from Members of Congress of both parties to accelerate our trade efforts and create new market access opportunities for American workers and producers I would also like to think we can agree on the need to conduct serious oversight of government spending to ensure that taxpayer dollars are being used efficiently and effectively Democrats forced through trillions of dollars in new spending during the last Congress and conducting oversight of how that money is being spent is nothing less than our responsibility as Members of Congress I am thinking in particular of the massive funding infusion 80 billion the Democrats handed to the IRS Especially given the IRS shaky record when it comes to handling taxpayer data I would hope we can agree that rigorous oversight of the IRS is required I also hope that my Democrat colleagues will be open to working to extend tax relief for American businesses and American families Americans and small businesses are going to face serious tax hikes if the tax relief from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act isn t extended or made permanent I would like to think that Members of both parties could work together to extend this tax relief and the benefits it provides for Americans Another thing that I am hoping will happen in this Congress is a return to regular order when it comes to appropriations bills and other legislation Omnibus appropriations bills are not an ideal way to fund the government to put it mildly They are an invitation for waste and all the other problems that come with hastily thrown together legislation and we need to do everything we can to make sure individual appropriations bills go through the committee process and are individually debated on the floor I am very encouraged that the incoming Democrat chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee has joined Senator Collins who will be the top ranking Republican on the committee to announce her desire to pass appropriations bills through regular order I really hope that that will be a bipartisan priority this year For similar reasons we need to put a greater emphasis on making sure nonappropriations bills especially the biggest bills that we consider go through regular order in committee where they could be publicly debated and amended and receive input from all committee members I hope that we can move forward a more collaborative and transparent process which is the kind of process that best serves the American people Getting anything done in divided government requires a genuine attitude of compromise with both sides conceding things rather than the my way or the highway approach that we have seen from Democrats over the past 2 years But if we can get there then I think we can achieve a lot together in this new Congress I am eager to work with my colleagues from both parties to address the challenges facing our country And for the good of the American people I hope we will build a record of bipartisan accomplishment over the next 2 years I yield the floor I suggest the absence of a quorum
879	Mr President on the Republican national sales tax the House Republicans keep churning this stuff out It is unbelievable In the 118th Congress it is already a tale of two parties Democrats united on one side Republicans in chaos on the other While Democrats are laser focused on making life better for everyday families Republicans are making it clear they want to help the very very wealthy the ultrarich While Democrats want to embrace collaboration and bipartisanship wherever possible Republicans seem to be trapped by MAGA extremism That is the contrast in a nutshell Democratic unity versus Republican chaos Democratic unity versus Republican chaos Yesterday I joined with President Biden the Vice President Leader Jeffries and Democratic colleagues from both Chambers to talk about how we Democrats can maintain our unity and turn it into action in order to help the American people Later today I will join with Leader Jeffries to further highlight the contrast between Democrats people first agenda and Republicans radical plans radical plans for a national sales tax Multiple extreme right Republicans say that Speaker McCarthy has promised them a vote on their national sales tax bill which they guilefully refer to as the FairTax Act Nothing could be less fair to the American people In a universe of bad ideas a Republican national sales tax reigns supreme This proposal pushed by the MAGA fringe who now controls the House Republican conference would impose a 30 percent tax on every single purchase Americans make just as inflation is beginning to drop This so called FairTax is truly foul legislation for American families For young families who want to buy a home well the Republican tax plan would add nearly 125 000 extra on top of the price you pay for your house an impossible sum for many young people struggling to get their start in life And what about Americans out there thinking of buying a car Under the Republican tax plan the average American would pay 10 000 more on that single purchase alone What about seniors getting ready for retirement A Republican national sales tax means people s life savings would suddenly lose 30 percent of their value Imagine working your entire life playing by the rules paying your taxes saving a little of each paycheck only to have Republicans swoop in and erase nearly a third a third of what you have saved up And it doesn t end there Under the Republican tax plan a mere trip to the grocery store would be torture Eggs are high enough right now at 4 25 a dozen They would be 5 50 under the Republican plan Milk right now is 4 40 It would cost 5 70 under the Republican plan The same holds true for everything else bread produce canned goods cleaning supplies soap shampoo toothpaste diapers you name it All of it would go up by a third for millions of families millions tens of millions probably hundreds of millions It would be a devastating blow But do you know who wouldn t mind a Republican national sales tax The ultrarich the ultrawealthy The top 1 percent of our earners wouldn t notice much change in expenses That is who would win under the Republicans proposal the very very rich because their taxes would be greatly reduced even further even worse than under the Trump tax cuts No wonder then that even Grover Norquist no friend of the Democrats calls this bill a terrible idea and an assault on your retirement savings Look if Republicans want to start their majority with a debate on their national sales tax bill Democrats would welcome it Let the American people see which party is fighting for everyday folks and which party is trying to rig the game in favor of the ultrarich It is a debate the American people need to see I yield the floor I suggest the absence of a quorum
880	Mr President the State of Illinois is my home and it holds an important place in the history of the American labor movement All of us learned the name Upton Sinclair in our early days in school the author of the 1906 novel The Jungle which told the story of the horrendous working conditions endured by largely immigrant workers in Chicago s meatpacking plants and led to Federal regulation A Philip Randolph founder of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters one of America s first unions for African American workers was a civil rights champion and a leader of the 1963 March on Washington There is also the story of Mary Harris Mother Jones an Irish immigrant who survived the Great Famine in Ireland the yellow fever epidemic of 1867 which took the lives of her husband and children and after her own dress shop was destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 she went on to become a woman labor organizer and a fierce and beloved champion of coal miners Before she died she said she wanted to be buried in a place of honor among coal miners She is buried in a town near my home called Mount Olive IL in the Union Miners Cemetery the only union owned cemetery in America Aside from being legends of labor history Upton Sinclair A Philip Randolph and Mother Jones had something else in common They are all members of the Illinois Labor History Society s Union Hall of Honor which was founded in 1969 to make sure that important figures and defining chapters of America s labor history are not forgotten The society s highest honor is to be named to its Union Hall of Honor Last month a longtime friend of mine John Penn was inducted into the Illinois Labor History Society s Union Hall of Honor After nearly 60 years of protecting workers rights in Illinois the Midwest and our Nation John has certainly earned that honor He is one of 113 men and women who have been inducted into the Union Hall of Honor but to me John is one in a million He got his first union card in 1965 when he was 16 years old joining the Laborers International Union of North America Local 362 in Bloomington IL He took a break by joining the United States Air Force serving in Vietnam Korea Guam and then returning back to Bloomington and Local 362 It was the same path taken a generation earlier by his father Paul Penn a World War II veteran who rose to become president of the same local But John s family connections didn t win any special treatment He had to rise through the ranks and rise he did from business manager of Local 362 to business manager of the 36 county North Central Illinois Laborers District Council then business manager of the four state Great Plains Laborers District Council and in 2008 vice president and regional manager of LIUNA s 10 State Midwest region and a member of the international union s general executive board positions to which he has been reelected three different times Under John Penn s leadership LIUNA Local 362 grew giving a voice to scores of workers who previously had never benefited from union representation Some years ago in response to several tragic accidents John made himself known to many by stopping all highway construction in McLean County to force the State of Illinois to improve protections for vulnerable construction workers and others on the State s roadways That action culminated in the creation of the Illinois State s Work Zone Safety Committee and implementation of numerous policies that saved lives Somehow John also found time to resurrect Bloomington s Labor Day parade to serve on several community and State boards including the United Way of McLean County the Children s Christmas Party for Unemployed Families Illinois Special Olympics the McLean County Promise Council and the Bloomington Normal Advancement and Economic Development Council He was honored by his hometown newspaper the Bloomington Pantagraph as its 2003 Person of the Year He received a Thousand Points of Light Foundation award from then President Clinton in 1997 in recognition of his volunteer efforts and those of all Bloomington Normal building tradespeople who he recruited over the years to take part in these organizations At the end of this month John Penn is retiring from this position with the Laborers union As he begins this new chapter Loretta and I wish John and Mary his wife of 55 years good health good times with their daughter Shawn their children and grandchildren John you made a real difference for so many people You are truly a hall of famer and thanks for all that you have done
881	Mr President today I have the honor of recognizing a true Montana hero Dr Daniel Edelman Dr Edelman is a veteran of the U S Army who was seriously injured on a mission while deployed overseas as the noncommissioned officer in charge of security and intelligence of the 1st Military Intelligence Battalion 1st Infantry Division Despite his severe injuries Dr Edelman pursued and obtained bachelor s master s and doctorate degrees along with several professional certifications allowing him to have a long and distinguished career serving his fellow Montanans While serving as chancellor at Montana State University Billings Dr Edelman championed many student causes with a particular focus on veterans disabilities first generation underserved and Native American students He worked with the FBI and other agencies to provide educational opportunities for victims of human trafficking and also entered into an agreement for MSUB to partner with the University of North Texas Health Science Center to identify human remains particularly those of murdered Native Americans Additionally he created a veterans success center at MSUB Dr Edelman helped raise the final funds for a science building and student scholarships Outside of his work at MSUB Dr Edelman volunteers by serving on the board of Horses Spirits Healing a nonprofit that helps veterans with PTSD After a career dedicated to serving Montana and our Nation Dr Edelman recently retired from MSUB due to a terminal condition connected to his time in the U S Army Dr Edelman truly embodies the values and the spirit of a Montanan and I have no doubt that his legacy of service will continue for many generations to come It is my honor to recognize Dr Edelman who is here in the Chamber today in the Gallery with his family I want to recognize Dr Edelman for his service to our great State our great Nation and for his dedication to improving the lives of his students and his fellow Montanan veterans Dr Edelman you have made Montana and our country very proud
882	Mr President in the last two centuries Federal support for scientific research has helped to split the atom defeat polio explore space create the internet map the human genome develop vaccines and treatments for COVID 19 and so much more No nation has made such significant investments in science and no nation s scientists have done more to improve the quality of life But with the challenges we face today from devastating diseases to climate change there is more progress to be made So America is at a turning point and unless we commit to providing strong and sustained funding increases for our Nation s premier medical and scientific researchers our position as the world leader will be at risk That is exactly why since 2014 I have continued to introduce legislation to keep our Nation on the cutting edge It is entitled the American Cures Act This bill will provide our top medical research Agencies with 5 percent real funding growth every year That is steady predictable growth pegged above the rate of inflation This money would support the National Institutes of Health the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the Department of Defense Health Program and the Veterans Affairs Medical and Prosthetics Research Program This investment would be game changing for the Agencies Consider the National Institutes of Health It is our Nation s if not the world s premier medical research Agency Their pioneering work at this single agency saves lives and fuels our economy supporting nearly 20 000 jobs just in my home State of Illinois Today the NIH budget is 47 5 billion More than 95 percent of this funding is competitively awarded to scientists research institutions and small businesses in every State across the country Researchers supported by the NIH make tens of thousands of new discoveries every year breakthroughs that could literally change the world In recognition of these remarkable feats Congress has on a bipartisan basis increased the NIH annual budget by more than 17 billion since I first introduced the American Cures Act in 2014 This chart is an indication of that growth It has gone from 30 billion to 48 billion in that period of time since 2014 a 58 percent increase These increases would not have been possible without a bipartisan effort in the U S Senate I enlisted a willing participant and ally and really effective Member of the Senate Patty Murray to be part of this former Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri who when the Republicans were in majority control of the Senate kept up this promise to increase the spending and retired Senator Lamar Alexander from Tennessee who shared our passion for medical research Luckily we had a leader at the time Dr Francis Collins former Director of the NIH who really did his part in enlisting support for these increases NIH is not the only Federal medical research Agency to see significant funding increases We have also secured 2 4 billion in increased funding for the CDC over the last 9 years That is a 35 percent increase since fiscal year 2014 And while it is not reflected in the chart I just showed both the CDC and NIH also received billions in supplemental funding from COVID rescue bills passed by the Senate in 2020 and 2021 While this year s budget provided a 5 8 percent bump to the NIH a 2 5 billion increase I am sorry to say we fell short of the 5 percent real growth target above inflation If we had met this target NIH would have received 650 million up to a level of more than 48 billion That said I am still encouraged about how far we have come We finally reversed a 22 percent decline in NIH purchasing power that took place after 12 years of flat funding but we need to step up our efforts Diseases like cancer stroke opioid addiction and mental illness will not wait on us Half of all men and one third of all women in the U S will develop cancer in their lifetime Someone s mother father brother sister or spouse is diagnosed with Alzheimer s disease every 65 seconds And 1 in every 300 people will be diagnosed with ALS in their lifetime Sadly a number of my closest friends already have received this diagnosis Sustained and robust NIH funding will help cure prevent and treat these diseases It will help the people that we all care about the most and it already has Because of NIH funding listen to this the American Cancer Society estimates that nearly 3 1 2 million lives were saved between 1991 and 2019 as a result of improvements in cancer treatment detection and prevention a 32 percent drop in the cancer death rate since 1991 Thirty years ago HIV was a death sentence but because of NIH research that is no longer the case And because of NIH funding we are also on the verge of curing yes curing sickle cell anemia an inherited blood disorder that primarily affects African Americans Consider this NIH funding contributed to research associated with every new drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration from 2010 to 2019 Let me repeat that for emphasis There are only two countries in the world that allow general advertising of prescription drugs the United States and New Zealand You can t turn on the television without hearing the story of a new drug Every single drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration from 2010 to 2019 started off with government funded taxpayer funded research at the National Institutes of Health So when you see these wonderful drugs understand we as Americans put down the initial investment that made these drugs all possible However there is a real threat to our Nation s investment in medical research The new House Republican majority after more than a dozen in fact 15 painful and embarrassing failed votes to secure the Speaker announced that Speaker McCarthy had finally won the day he made some deals agreements with MAGA Republicans for that to happen One of those agreements would literally devastate funding for medical research in the future What a price to pay He reportedly agreed to hamstring government funding for 2024 at 2022 levels a senseless move senseless move that would cut funding for scientific breakthroughs by roughly 7 percent and delay the delivery of new cures and treatments for those most in need So I would like to know for the record which diseases and conditions would Speaker McCarthy and the House Republicans like us to slash funding for Cancer Alzheimer s Parkinson s Diabetes ALS Heart disease Which one Speak up Mr Speaker This is supposed to be a new transparent House of Representatives If you are going to cut funding in medical research what can we put on the back of the burner and how can we explain that to the families across America Now is not the time for political horse trading that puts one person in power at the expense of everyone waiting for a cure We need to build on the bipartisan success which we have had to date and we have achieved over the past decade and continue to prioritize medical research funding that creates jobs but most importantly saves lives I yield the floor
883	Now Mr President to talk about what I came here to talk about talk about the border I live in a border State We have 1 200 miles of border with Mexico We have as a country 2 000 miles of border with Mexico And we are seeing numbers of people showing up at the border that we have never seen before millions of people since President Biden was sworn in as President on January 20 2021 millions of people showing up many of whom are claiming asylum and seeking to immigrate permanently into the United States under the asylum laws Because the administration has a policy of releasing those individuals into the interior of the United States to await a future immigration court hearing which may be years in the future because of backlog many of those individuals do not show up at their immigration court hearing but simply are willing to play the odds that they can just melt into the Great American heartland and not be returned or repatriated to their country of origin or actually have to appear at an asylum hearing We know that statistically the number of people who actually do show up for an asylum hearing in front of an immigration judge only roughly 90 percent of them fail to meet the very stringent requirement for asylum which is basically a credible fear of persecution based on some classification race sex ethnic origin or the like That is a very narrow test and it certainly does not include fear of poverty or even violence in your home country Yet the policy of the Biden administration to basically create open borders and place individuals who show up and claim asylum these are not people trying to run away from the Border Patrol by the way These are people who are turning themselves in because they know they can play the system and they will be able to make their way into the United States without any consequences certainly no legal consequences I am sure those of my colleagues who have visited the border and we had a bipartisan group just a couple weeks ago who did visit again both Yuma AZ and El Paso But as my colleagues can attest there is no data there is no image there frankly or no words to adequately convey the complexity of what is happening at the border today To understand you have to see and hear for yourself Several years ago I traveled to Brooks County which is a little county in South Texas where I visited a ranch that the Border Patrol had a rescue beacon in the middle of And just to explain the Border Patrol does a lot of humanitarian rescues because as you can imagine people coming from Central America up across the land bridge into Mexico up to the United States many of them show up dehydrated suffering from exposure and some of them frankly die on the trip But the Border Patrol while they have the responsibility of enforcing our immigration laws at the border and interdicting illegal drugs they also rescue migrants who are in distress And what these rescue beacons are out in the middle of nowhere frankly what they are are large poles with a light on top that allows migrants who are sick injured or otherwise in distress to contact law enforcement for help and immediately get access to first aid water food whatever they need There is a sign at the bottom of these rescue beacons that instructs the migrants to press a red button for help and to remain in the area Well when I first went to Brooks County which is where this Falfurrias is probably the largest inland port where the Border Patrol has a checkpoint in Brooks County I was surprised to see the rescue beacons not written in just English not just written in Spanish but in Mandarin Mandarin This is Brooks County TX a rural county 70 or so miles from the U S Mexico border and the rescue beacon is in Chinese the Chinese language This is a factoid about the border crisis that doesn t get nearly the attention that it deserves What this tells me and what I have learned subsequently is that migrants aren t just coming from Mexico They are not just coming from Central America They are literally coming from all around the world Now when I hear for example Vice President Harris or the President of the United States or Secretary of State Blinken talk about the migration crisis they want to talk about root causes And I think although that is a little bit vague I think what they are talking about is they view migration as an economic crisis people living in their home country who are seeking a better life which we all certainly understand or fleeing violence they want to talk about root causes But I think what they don t understand or certainly aren t articulating is the fact that this is far broader than a regional problem concentrated in Mexico and Central America I think the fact that these rescue beacons have been for many years written in English Spanish and Mandarin is evidence of the fact that this is a far larger problem but one that the administration has simply not acknowledged A couple of weeks ago I traveled with a bipartisan delegation of colleagues to El Paso TX which is the westernmost point in my State Actually just a bit of trivia the city of El Paso is closer to the Pacific Ocean than it is to the eastern tip of Texas to give you an idea of the scope of what we are talking about It is a big place But we traveled to El Paso TX which is an urban area but we also went to Yuma AZ which if you look on the map is the southwestern portion of Arizona another border State just right up against California But it is an agricultural community I think it is fair to say I am not disparaging it it is kind of a sleepy little agricultural town We met a number of people in El Paso and Yuma whom I want to mention In El Paso we went out on a night patrol with the Border Patrol They got on their horses and they rode over this large area where there is a lot of traffic And then we were informed that they had detained two migrants And so we walked over there to sort of see what was going on and the Border Patrol said Well these two are from China El Paso TX two Chinese migrants trying to make their way across the border As a matter of fact one of the Border Patrol Agents had to use an app on the phone I think it is called Google Translate in order to communicate with these migrants Then when we went to one of the detention facilities or processing facilities actually not actually detention we met a family from Uzbekistan while touring the Border Patrol Central Processing Center in El Paso not in Mexico not Central America but Uzbekistan You can look that up on the map It is not a part of the region that the President the Secretary of State and Vice President are talking about when they are talking about root causes of illegal immigration But when we went to Yuma the little sleepy agricultural town on the border of Mexico and the United States the Acting Border Patrol Chief told us that one of the unusual features of a number of the migrants who came across Yuma were they came from 176 different countries and they spoke more than 200 languages And you might ask How in the world is that possible Well Senator Kelly one of the Arizona Senators said Well there is an airport right across the border in Mexico at the northern border in a city called Mexicali Again if you look at your map of Mexico you will see that Mexicali is a pretty large urban area right there on the Arizona border And people fly into there Of course they have to pay human smugglers criminal organizations that are a network that smuggle human beings for money from anywhere in the world to that airport and then they walk across or walk up to the Yuma Border Patrol and claim asylum They noted that many of them are apparently well to do Somebody mentioned Gucci luggage I don t know whether Gucci makes luggage or not but you get the idea These are the not the sort of mental pictures that I think many people have of migrants who are seeking a better life necessarily fleeing poverty I should say or fleeing violence So the reason I mention this is because the reality of what is happening on the ground along the border undercuts the rhetoric we hear from the administration about how to solve this problem The White House has pushed a narrative that the only way to fix the border crisis is to fix the root causes of migration meaning the economic and security concerns that cause people to come here It has honed in on the Northern Triangle including El Salvador Guatemala and Honduras as the primary region of concern The administration s border czar Vice President Harris even led the development of the root causes strategy The problem is the data shows that this is not the region driving illegal migration Last month Customs and Border Protection encountered more than a quarter of a million migrants at the southern border Fewer than 33 000 of those 250 000 were from Northern Triangle countries 33 000 out of the 250 000 were from Northern Triangle countries So these are the three countries that the administration is focused on It reminds me of the story of people who look through a soda straw at a problem Well they can look down the soda straw and they can see what is happening there but they don t see what is happening around it and they lose any sense of context or the complete picture That is what the administration is doing when they are looking at the border and the humanitarian and national security crisis occurring there on a daily basis and in my State s backyard As a matter of fact these three countries represent only about 13 percent of the migrants encountered at the southern border in December Mexican nationals the large country right on our southern border Mexico is not driving the numbers either Only 19 percent of the border encounters in December were Mexican nationals So where are all these men and women and children coming from Well you can take a global map a map of the world and you can take a dart and throw the dart at the map and you are likely to hit a place where these migrants are coming from Last year across the entire border Customs and Border Protection encountered migrants from 174 different countries People from every corner of the globe are traveling through Mexico and crossing America s southern border There is no question that the conditions in Mexico and the Northern Triangle are contributing but they are only a small fraction of the problem People around the world see the Biden administration catching and releasing migrants by the thousands on a daily basis They see the yearslong wait for asylum cases to be adjudicated They see the lack of any interior enforcement by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and as they look at this picture they realize that if they can make it across the southern border they are likely to be able to stay in the United States for years if not a lifetime Despite what the administration may think this is not just a regional problem it is a global phenomenon run by transnational criminal organizations That ought to concern all of us Last year CBP encountered migrants from 174 different countries If the administration wants to fix the root causes of this crisis are they going to fix the world You can see why their misconception their misunderstanding their erroneous narrative of what the problem is doesn t help solve the problem It is time for the Biden administration to acknowledge the reality of the situation and look at solutions that are realistic and effective In order to get this crisis under control we have to move quickly on a bipartisan basis to insist on the enforcement of our immigration laws when people attempt to enter our country other than through legal means That is the only viable path forward and the sooner the administration understands that the better off we will all be I yield the floor
884	Mr President I came to the floor to talk about the border one more time but I was intrigued by the rhetorical questions my friend from Illinois has asked the Speaker I have got a question for President Biden When you say that you are not going to negotiate on the debt ceiling does that mean that the Federal Government is going to continue to rack up more and more debt on top of the 30 trillion that we already owe particularly during inflationary times when interest rates on that debt basically are eating up more and more of our discretionary budget To me if the answer is yes I am going to refuse to negotiate as we continue to rack up more and more debt about two thirds of which is on autopilot as the Presiding Officer knows it is mandatory spending That is a supremely irresponsible position to take President Biden when he was in the Senate was known as a dealmaker and as I said yesterday during 2011 he negotiated with Senator McConnell the Budget Control Act which was probably the most recent response sort of a mixed bag as it was to try to control Federal spending It was a noble effort although it did not succeed So I know our friends on the Democratic side would like to sort of add to Mr McCarthy s challenges We have got 6 months perhaps between now and the time the extraordinary measures the Treasury Department is going to be using to make sure we don t actually breach that debt limit but I would suggest that the time would be better used rather than sort of to add gasoline to the fire to actually try to solve the problem And the problem the debt limit is real It needs to be addressed by two people Speaker McCarthy and the President of the United States Because anything the Senate were to pass with 60 votes which would be required would certainly be dead on arrival in the House of Representatives And so as a practical matter while we are going to be very interested and engaged in the debate and discussion that is where the decision is going to have to be made sometime between now and the time extraordinary measures are exhausted perhaps as early as June But in the meantime for the President of the United States who represents not just Democrats who represents all Americans all 330 million plus of us to say I am not negotiating even though he has got a track record as a Senator and as a Vice President of negotiating hard things like this to me is an irresponsible answer and I hope he will reconsider
885	Mr. Speaker I rise today at the beginning of this new year to talk about a problem we have talked about a lot but unfortunately we haven t gotten the results we need and that is to talk about our southern border It is not a new topic for me I have been on the floor many times talking about this as have my colleagues and it is not a new topic for the American people because they see this every day and many people are living it very close up Many of my colleagues can say the same because this is a topic they have unfortunately had to discuss over and over and over again with no real results and we are going to hear from some of them today Years ago on this Senate floor I said I urge my colleagues here in the Senate to take a long hard look at the undisputed facts that demonstrate the crisis at the border is escalating When I said those words it was December 2018 The number of apprehensions along the southern border then was a little more than 60 000 Over the weekend Customs and Border Protection released the numbers for this past December and apprehensions along our southern border were reported at 251 487 an alltime high You can see from the chart I have here you might not be able to read the numbers but the dark blue is what we have been doing all through 2022 far eclipsing the light blue of 2021 which were record numbers But here again in the dark purple which is the lower one this is the average from fiscal year 2013 to 2020 and many times this is five times six times the amount in December That is startling startling But one thing that has changed over these last 2 years fortunately is that the President finally decided to visit the southern border He went to El Paso several weeks ago Well it is about time It certainly shouldn t have taken that long to visit a part of our country that is deeply affected by these numbers but he finally went down I have been to the southern border many times I am sure Mr. Speaker you have been there many times as well quite a bit over the years We just had several codels go down these past couple weeks The President has been saying of Republicans that it is easy to demagogue the issue and reject solutions So here is what I have to say to the President in response to that No Mr President it is not easy to demagogue It is easy to see that the issue is not getting the attention that it deserves by this administration The chart pretty much says it all right there The Biden administration often pivots to calling for comprehensive immigration reform and that Congress needs to provide the resources Some of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are discussing these very issues But this is not an either or scenario Any discussions about the need for and the way we reform our immigration system are separate and apart from the need to enforce the laws to secure the border I am particularly struck by the President s comment on solutions To explain these record numbers almost each and every month we have been told The surge is seasonal By the way December is traditionally as you can see one of the lower months over the years so the seasonal charge cannot be the issue The surge was the result of particular political conditions in relative countries Well we see people coming in from hundreds of countries not just surging from political conditions in a country Our economy is a magnet It very well could be It is a surge for asylum or those fleeing countries that are impacted by natural disasters All of these things these excuses are from the administration One thing is clear Thousands of individuals and families are continually coming into our country unaccounted for draining the resources of many of our communities But Congress needs to do our part to provide the funds and support for the men and women in the Agencies that are tasked with securing our border enforcing our immigration laws and stemming the flow of drugs particularly fentanyl from getting into our country I stand ready to do that and have done that through my work on the Appropriations Committee as the ranking member on Homeland Security Now you may disagree with the tone and tactics of the last administration but I think everyone can agree that border security was certainly a priority and that is why so many of us called for President Biden to go to the border himself and see the crisis for himself The numbers under President Trump were measurably less because of his policies There is an irony here because after 2 years of neglect we have seen the need to go to the border in a way dwindled because the border crisis has actually come to the President come to Washington DC come to West Virginia come to Denver But some of the most critical comments about the impacts and failures of these policies have not come from Republicans but from a mayor of a town along the Rio Grande or from the Democratic mayor of the city of New York Mayor Adams mayor of New York City has called this situation not just a crisis but instead he has called it a disaster exactly what it is Mayor Adams is now seeking funds to help house those tens of thousands of migrants who are arriving in New York City Cities far into the interior of our country are being stretched to the max from the migrant surge This is why we have to do everything we can to stem the influx We just passed an Omnibus appropriations bill that increases funding for these activities particularly at CBP ICE and FEMA for personnel and for technology But imagine the men and women who have to deal with this all the time the fatigue the morale the difficulties when you are so overrun They are just pressed beyond capacity month after month and year after year Each year we have worked in a bipartisan way within Homeland Security to encourage and fund increased hiring for Border Patrol agents for example We are way down on those But it has been difficult to fill these positions or to even maintain the current force One of the things I am most proud about in my tenure as ranking member on the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee is the creation and funding of a new position for CBP called the processing coordinators We did this because too many of our trained agents were pulled from their duty stations and their mission to perform tasks that they are not prepared to do This balance enables Agencies to go back to actually performing tasks they are supposed to do they are equipped for and they are trained for In addition to increasing resources for CBP we must also be making efforts to increase interior enforcement Once they get through the border and they declare asylum they are told to come back in 5 to 7 years Many of them don t but that is what they are and they are in the interior of the country and we don t use the interior enforcement mechanisms that we have It is very unacceptable that thousands upon thousands are waiting in some cases waiting 7 years before they can even begin any kind of removal procedures We just cannot let this crisis continue Bottom line The issue was not a priority of the first 2 years of this administration That is very obvious As I said the chart this is the second year of the President s administration This is the first year which is way above the averages but it definitely cannot be ignored The impact on too many families too many businesses and too many communities along the southern border even in our State of West Virginia simply cannot be ignored I am glad the President went and now he is fully aware hopefully of the problem I sure hope he is ready and willing to act I yield the floor
886	Mr. Speaker I gave my remarks on border security and as the new vice chair of the Republican conference I have gathered some really strong voices here to share in the concerns that I have I am really pleased to have the chair of our policy committee here Senator Ernst from Iowa
887	Mr President I would thank my colleague the senior Senator from Texas for his comments and his perspective and his insight as a Senator serving from a border State on what they are facing every single day I would say to my colleague that Nebraska has become a border State I know Colorado has become a border State Every State in this country now is feeling the effects of the chaos that we see at our southern border so my thanks to the senior Senator from Texas for offering his perspective on that I would say that on January 13 in Nebraska we had two Nebraska State Patrol officers who pulled over two separate vehicles that were hours away from each other One car contained 50 000 suspected fentanyl pills The other contained a suspected fentanyl cocaine mixture Both cars were driven up from the border These are only the latest instances of synthetic opioid trafficking in my State of Nebraska In 2022 the Nebraska State Patrol confiscated 66 pounds of fentanyl and that is up from 25 pounds the year before and 10 pounds in 2020 In Nebraska and throughout this Nation the numbers of drug seizures are staggering At the southwest border there was a 55 percent increase in fentanyl seizures from just November to December Heroin seizures increased by 52 percent the month before Methamphetamine seizures increased as well We know what is driving these drug trafficking numbers We have a crisis at our southern border The effects of that crisis are rippling across the country felt by communities in Nebraska and beyond When we cannot control who is entering the United States what they are bringing in or where they are going that is a serious national security risk Let s go over the numbers Customs and Border Protection encountered 2 3 million migrants at the southern border this past fiscal year more encounters than any other year in our history Migrant encounters in December reached the highest monthly level ever recorded with over 250 000 encounters in 1 month That number had tripled in just 2 years And it gets even worse Border Patrol agents have stopped individuals on the government s terror watch list 38 times so far since October Suspected terrorist encounters will hit record levels if this trend continues through 2023 Gang affiliated encounters skyrocketed last year as well from 348 to 751 These historic statistics should concern anyone who cares about our country s security and the safety of our communities and the safety of American families But this administration doesn t consider what is going on at the border to be a crisis In fact our President hardly seems to consider what is going on at the border at all Despite his recent trip south for what I thought was a photo op his administration has exacerbated the border crisis In case anybody has forgotten let me refresh your memories With simple strokes of his pen President Biden ended the national emergency declaration at the border He halted construction on the border wall and he scaled back ICE enforcement in the first few months of his Presidency No amount of photo ops can change what we all know This administration has not only failed to prioritize the safety and security of our border it has put forward policies over the past 2 years that have worsened this crisis Only a month ago President Biden himself insisted that there are more important things going on I happen to think the national security threat posed by an influx of suspected terrorists across the border is important I think that human trafficking overrunning our border is important I think the massive increase in overdoses due to drug smuggling across the border is important Across the country fentanyl is now the leading cause of death for Americans ages 18 to 49 Between 2019 and 2021 Nebraska s largest county saw an appalling 400 percent increase in fentanyl overdose deaths Complacency is not an acceptable response to this atrocious uptick in loss of life My Republican colleagues and I have real commonsense solutions to the problems that our border is facing We need to invest more in new border security measures and resources for the men and women who serve us honorably as Border Patrol agents We need to end the lenient policies like catch and release and increase penalties for people who don t show up for their immigration court hearings We need the Department of Homeland Security to create a serious comprehensive strategy to address those issues Simply throwing more tax dollars toward a smartphone app that offers migrants appointments to cross our border well that is what the Biden administration has proposed It is not the right response to the mayhem we are seeing Their policies do nothing to secure the border and to reinforce our Nation s security Until President Biden and my Democratic colleagues seriously work with us to fix this border chaos once and for all we can expect to see more drugs brought into our country more women and children facing a life of sex trafficking and more threats to the security of our Nation I yield the floor I suggest the absence of a quorum
888	Mr. Speaker I do want to thank my friend and colleague Senator Capito of West Virginia for her leadership in bringing Senate Republicans to the floor to talk about what is a very important issue to all of our constituents the safety and the security of our great Nation Joe Biden created a crisis that has now turned into a complete catastrophe one a mere photo op at a cleaned up site in Texas won t fix In just 2 years under President Biden over 4 million illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border 151 who are on the terror watch list To top that off we know of at least 1 2 million individuals who evaded the authorities Those are the individuals we call the got aways This border catastrophe is so much more than a flood of illegal immigrants hoping to jump the legal immigration line to get in the door An open border is an invitation for mischief It is a drug lord s dream In my home State of Iowa drug overdoses among young people have risen 120 percent in the last few years According to the State s Division of Criminal Investigation there were four times the amount of fentanyl pills disguised as prescription drugs in 2022 as compared to the previous year We must act now to counter this deadly fentanyl epidemic We as lawmakers should make the distribution of fentanyl resulting in death punishable by Federal felony murder charges It is past time the consequences for intentionally inflicting an overdose fits the crime The cartels producing and smuggling this deadly drug into the United States are also funneling a significant number of illegal firearms and weapons leading to barbaric violence Just last week in California a family of six including a 10 month old baby girl was killed in a drug cartel execution Unfortunately the suspects are still at large Folks this death and devastation cannot continue In the coming weeks I am looking forward to leading a bicameral delegation to the California Mexico border There we plan to hear directly from Customs and Border Protection personnel about fentanyl and their ongoing drug interdictions We will tour the port in San Diego the epicenter for fentanyl trafficking into the United States and get a firsthand look at the dangerous and critical work our Border Patrol agents are doing day in and day out I anticipate a common theme in all of our conversations the need to physically secure our border something my colleagues on the other side of the aisle used to support In 2007 then Senator Joe Biden argued No great country can say it s secure without being able to secure its borders In 2010 Senator Chuck Schumer supported border security and agreed the border lacked the resources to fully combat the drug smugglers gun runners human traffickers money launderers and organized criminals that seek to do harm to innocent Americans along our border Amen folks I agree with both of them But where is that same attitude now when the southern border has become immensely more dangerous more permeable and more lethal At every single one of my townhalls over the past 3 weeks and in dozens of interviews with Iowa media I was asked about the crisis at the southern border So to those on the left who say this is just a Republican stunt I think you had better get out of the beltway and into Middle America hear directly from the people you are supposed to serve and you will quickly find out it is no stunt it is reality Iowa families want solutions They want safety and they want to curtail the ever increasing access to deadly drugs for their children and they are not alone The American people want a solution In fact over a majority of Americans 73 percent according to one Pew Research poll say they believe we need to increase security along the U S Mexico border It is a great place to start a place to find common ground In fact there are left over border materials from the Trump administration just lying out in the desert materials that taxpayers have paid for that are just collecting dust And get this The Federal Government is actually paying yes they have hired contractors and they spend our tax dollars to do this to watch over those materials that are lying there in the desert Without a secure border we cannot have a larger conversation about reforming our immigration system So maybe just maybe a good place to start is for this administration to allow States that want to complete the border barrier to do so instead of taking them to court Besides doesn t Biden s Justice Department have enough on their hands right now So I agree with the Senator from West Virginia that this is an issue that needs to be addressed With that I suggest the absence of a quorum
889	Mr. Speaker I have been on this floor many times to speak to this body about the issue of immigration on our southwest border It is an issue It has been an issue for the past couple of years and unfortunately it continues to get worse As I talk to people in Oklahoma they are very open to immigration They just want legal immigration and they want our system set up in such a way to incentivize legal immigration But that is not what is happening right now Seven of us 2 weeks ago in a bipartisan codel went to the southwest border and we spent a couple of days there in the El Paso area and then over into Yuma AZ just to be able to visit with the folks on the line with the folks in the communities to be able to talk to those individuals who are taking care of human needs to say What is going on on the ground What do we need to know I have been to the border many times So I have had the opportunity to be able to hear some of the other reports but it is always interesting just to be able to get the perspective of what is happening right now because as they say along the border if you have been to one spot on the border you have been to one spot on the border because it is different in each area what they are facing Let me give you just one story from this When we visited with the sheriff and with the city manager and with the mayor of a small town in Arizona named Yuma AZ Yuma AZ is right on the border It is an ag community If you have eaten a salad in the past year you have eaten something from Yuma AZ because they grow the vast majority of the lettuce for our country Yuma AZ 3 years ago in that area had 8 100 people illegally cross in that year For that one small town they were trying to manage 8 100 people crossing 3 years ago This past year Yuma AZ had 310 000 people illegally cross the area So in 3 years they went from 8 000 people illegally crossing to 310 000 people illegally crossing in a year They are overwhelmed May I remind you the mayor of New York is worried about an additional 40 to 50 000 people in New York City and having a difficult time absorbing that Yuma AZ is trying to figure out how to absorb 310 000 people coming through their community The issues are complicated and they are difficult but they are not unachievable It is an issue of how are we going to enforce the law Now I would tell you that I have met with the Border Patrol many times over the years and one of the things they will often talk to me about is that they finally get a break each December because typically of Christmas quite frankly not as many people cross illegally during Christmastime They stay home with families And so December is usually a down month for illegal crossings and it is year after year after year until this year This year there was a record number of people illegally crossing in December So instead of going down it actually went up when a quarter million people illegally crossed our southwest border in 1 month That was last month in December a quarter million people This is a growing issue that requires attention and it is not just the people this year It is also all the other complications that come with it because the Border Patrol is very clear While we are managing this massive number of people coming from all over the world across that border we can t go interdict drugs we can t go interdict other things because we don t have the manpower to be able to do both So again last month drug seizures in the United States increased 17 5 percent In 1 month it went up This is an issue that requires real focus and my concern is that the numbers are so large and it is so out of control that people are just saying It is too big I am not going to deal with it But the chaos along our border is continuing Now the administration has made some bold statements of late They said we are going to dramatically increase the number of people who are going to have expedited removal attached to them Now that sounds really severe expedited removal They are going to have extradited removal when they get there Except when we ran the numbers to be able to look at it at how many people are actually removed who get expedited removal the number came back 7 percent So expedited removal doesn t actually mean removal It is just a title that is being placed on individuals So nothing is really changing there And as I mentioned before these are not just individuals from Central America or from Mexico These are individuals coming from all over the world When our bipartisan codel was down on the border a few weeks ago we watched two individuals who had just been picked up by mounted patrol as they were running across the border But they were not running faster than the mounted patrol which was able to catch up with them and they were able to arrest them Those two individuals were Chinese nationals who were making their way across the border illegally at night running from the Border Patrol People from all over the world are coming because there is an invitation to illegally cross the border People are coming right now because it is actually easier to get a job in America If you are living in another country and you want to work in America it is easier to get a job in America if you illegally cross That is not just me saying that That is the data saying that If you are outside the United States and you apply for a work visa and want to be able to come in in a legal normal process to be able to go through currently it is 6 1 2 months to be able to get that work visa 6 1 2 months But if you illegally cross our border and you are labeled with parole and the mass number of people are labeled with parole when they illegally cross our border you get a work permit within 3 to 4 weeks So you could legally do this and wait 6 1 2 months or you could illegally do this and you get it in 3 to 4 weeks Literally this administration is incentivizing illegal activity with how they are setting up the work permits Listen there are a lot of things this Congress needs to do to be able to deal with illegal immigration I have stated over and over and over again that the asylum laws need to change We have got to do a real fix This is the issue and it has been multiple administrations that have said that this is the problem In fact this administration just in the last month has floated the idea of changing the regulation on how they actually handle asylum and I have affirmed them for that That has got to change in the way it is being implemented It also needs to change in law in the way we handle it here But there is also the legal process of actually enforcing our laws on the southern border that will make a significant difference not incentivizing individuals to be able to illegally cross our border There are things the administration can do and they are not doing currently There are things that this body needs to do that we have not taken up Two hundred and fifty thousand people illegally crossed our southwest border last month When are we going to act on this problem It needs to be now With that I yield the floor
890	Mr. Speaker I want to thank my friend and colleague from Mississippi for her comments on this subject I am down here on the floor to also talk about the crisis at the border the humanitarian crisis the Homeland Security crisis and a crisis that is resulting in cartels making 800 million a year in human trafficking I joined a bipartisan delegation 2 weeks ago We visited the border It was very productive It was one of the first bipartisan delegations in quite some time The reason that was important is if you go down there with a partisan delegation you are only going to actually talk about one side of the issue If you go down there with a bipartisan delegation you can talk about what we need to do on a bipartisan basis to solve the crisis at the border I want to start where Senator Hyde Smith finished the humanitarian crisis I am one of the Members who has been trying to negotiate a bipartisan immigration reform bill that has border security and asylum reform in it I had a lot of my staff ask me Why would you do that You know it is going to be unpopular You are going to get criticized from the left for going too far You are going to get criticized from the right for having any discussion about immigration reform I have been down to the border several times I told my staff that it is hard for me to forget border security telling me that they just transported an 11 year old girl who had been repeatedly raped so much so she screamed so long she couldn t even speak anymore before she crossed the border I told them I can t forget going down the Rio Grande River and seeing a corpse taken out of the river realtime while I was down there It wasn t staged because it is happening repeatedly every year When you hear stories of truckloads of people being bused across the border 53 of them dying through suffocation and heat exposure on American soil I can t forget that That is a humanitarian crisis that has to be solved Then I went to the border last week and I started at the Rio Grande Sector and then I went over to the Yuma sector At night at the Rio Grande Sector we saw two Chinese nationals who had been apprehended Chinese nationals pay on average about 35 000 to cross the border In many cases they don t have the money to do it They have somebody invest in them and then they become indentured servants in the United States to pay off that debt You have people pay 5 000 6 000 10 000 who have an expectation from the cartel that they have a debt to be repaid That may be an honest job that they could get or that could be an illegal activity that helps the cartels Now we go over to the Yuma Sector The Yuma Sector is in Western Arizona There is a section of border there that hasn t been completed It is about 7 miles wide But the most important part of that 7 miles is about a 12 foot gate Three years ago 8 000 people crossed through that gate 2 years ago 200 000 people crossed through that same 12 foot gate and over the last 12 months 300 000 people have Five thousand of them were Russian nationals another 5 000 were Chinese nationals Look I understand why people want to get out of Russia and I understand why people want to get out of China What I don t understand is why on Earth in transit to that border that dangerous crossing that you are paying tens of thousands of dollars to a cartel a transnational criminal organization why on Earth wouldn t you stop in a nation that is safe the first safe country that you can get to out of the country that you are trying to flee from That is how international asylum treaties work You get out of the dangerous country You go to a country that has international agreements on asylum You claim asylum And then you may even want to seek asylum in the United States We had reports in the Yuma Sector of people who are flying into Mexicali They are flying in not making the trek as many people think of caravans coming from Central America through Mexico flying into Mexicali with suitcases and bags and taking a cab to the border making sure their toll is paid and then crossing the border There is no way on Earth that people coming from many of these nations could not have sought asylum somewhere closer to home and then give us a chance for orderly entry In total it is estimated that the transnational criminal organizations the cartels are being paid almost 800 million a year What are they doing with that If you go down to the border particularly if you go down there around midnight they play the same play every night 7 days a week 365 days a year They will take innocent people who are going to come across the border and they tell them Once you get across the border present yourself to a Border Patrol agent and you will be processed which is exactly what happens Under the Biden administration you are likely to be released within a few days or not more than about a week The disturbing trend is the one that Senator Hyde Smith talked about the disturbing number of people who are evading Border Patrol Why on Earth would you not opt to go into a facility that is heated in the winter and cooled in the summer and spend a week of being fed three times a day to have access to facilities to have changing tables for babies to have play areas while they are being detained and processed Why on Earth would you avoid all that and take the dangerous step of evading detection unless at least for some of them there is a nefarious purpose Then they are moving into communities where we have already seen in North Carolina an illegal immigrant murdered a young lady just a couple of years ago We have seen this crime and it tracks back almost invariably to the people who are the so called got aways Now I want to go to the Yuma Sector and talk about those 300 000 Border Patrol I am wearing a Back the Blue flag But as you all know if it is Border Patrol they wear green uniforms so I say Back Law Enforcement Right now Border Patrol only has less than half of the people who are sworn to protect the border doing those jobs They are in processing facilities They are driving buses They are providing support for daycare Literally I am not exaggerating So that means that we have half as many people protecting a border that has wide open spaces There are no structures whatsoever Come across Walk through the Rio Grande In most cases you can You don t have to swim But when those 300 000 people get there this is the most amazing thing about this country they are going through that 12 foot gate If Border Patrol goes there then the rest of the border is open for the got aways Our country is so extraordinary that they say I know that it is only about a 10 minute ride from that 12 foot gate to the processing facility but they won t transport a child unless they have a car seat for them If somebody has disabilities they have to make special accommodations Imagine 300 000 300 000 people coming across the border in a 12 month period what Border Patrol has to do to conform to our laws and treat these people humanely and safely They need time Time can only come when Congress recognizes that we have to secure the border We have to fill the gaps We have to insist that if you want to come to this country present yourself at a legal port of entry present a request for asylum you will be processed We need to send the message If you want to come to the United States thank you for the compliment you are willing to risk your life to come to the United States but respect our laws and don t pay cartels 800 million a year so that they can create a conduit for fentanyl and other drugs that are poisoning almost 100 000 Americans a year Now let s talk about immigration reform I think that one of the ways that we can provide a future flow a downward pressure on future flow is to simply say to people who want to respect our laws and apply for citizenship for work visas or other forms of being in this country legally we need to actually fix the immigration laws that we have on the books to do that If we do that I am not going to have to worry about those memories of that little girl I am not going to have to worry about the corpses that we are picking up in Texas Arizona and New Mexico I believe we will have fewer people dying from fentanyl because less of it will come here for a couple reasons We will have better security at the border and we will bankrupt the cartels that are making over the last 2 years almost 2 billion We need people in Congress to recognize that a bipartisan solution is possible We have a crisis at the border that needs to be solved and we have to have an administration that spends more than four hours in 2 years at the border recognizing it is on them to help us fix it
891	Mr. Speaker I started the new year by joining Senator Blackburn of Tennessee and our new colleague Senator Britt of Alabama on a recent tour of the Del Rio Border Sector in Texas We traveled to the border to gain more firsthand knowledge of the ongoing mass migration of illegal immigrants into our Nation to hear from Border Patrol agents about how they are handling this crisis and to perhaps more powerfully hear from young women and girls who are victims of President Biden s careless border and immigration policies We learned more how States are taking action to protect their citizens and their borders when the administration won t Few States are affected more than Texas which instituted Operation Lone Star in March of 2021 to counter illegal immigration and drug trafficking We looked on as a family led by a coyote crossed the Rio Grande in dangerously cold waters and witnessed the family s struggle to help their grandmother wade through rushing waters to enter our Nation illegally She made it safely across but sadly that is not always the case for many people including children who have drowned making the same trek under the misguided belief that our borders are open We visited a massive migrant processing center where illegal immigrants were taken upon arrival An astonishing fact about this processing center is that it costs U S taxpayers 16 million a month to operate and that is just one of five on the southern border Let me say that again It is costing American taxpayers 16 million per month to process illegal immigrants at just one of these five centers What was especially gut wrenching to me was hearing directly from human trafficking victims We heard from one young lady who was trafficked from the age of 12 to the age of 16 She told a story I will never forget and there are thousands of stories just like hers Yes we learned about the true severity of the crisis We learned how Border Patrol agents simply cannot carry out their jobs We learned how States are forced to use up resources on border security and migrants resources meant for U S citizens We learned how ranchers and U S property owners are being overwhelmed and in constant fear of being robbed and assaulted by smugglers We learned how all of this affects our entire Nation not just the unbelievable pricetag but in the incidences of human trafficking across the country and tens of thousands of overdose deaths linked to fentanyl smuggled across our border And heartbreakingly we learned of the wickedness of the cartels They are thriving thanks to President Biden s apathetic attitude toward his own country s border This should not be a political debate People and children are dying in an attempt to enter our country illegally Drug cartels are taking control of not just the border towns on the Mexican side of the border but on the American side too Human trafficking is now a 13 billion industry How did we get here Why do they come Well because our President basically invited them Immediately after President Biden was sworn in he started dismantling vital policies like Remain in Mexico and restarted catch and release halted construction on the border and essentially set up a big neon sign on the southwest border that read Vacant The rest is history 4 5 million border apprehensions with an estimated 1 5 million undetected got aways a staggering increase in the number of women and children who are being subject to assault and domestic violence fentanyl flowing into our communities and skyrocketing deaths I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to go and listen to Border Patrol agents Hear the stories of the cartel victims See for yourself the heartbreaking scenarios the greatest country in the world is allowing to unfold I learned much from my visit to the border but perhaps the worst thing I learned is this The Biden administration is not lacking any resources or authority to address this crisis No it can support our Border Patrol and border States It can secure our border It can save children from dying and drowning in the Rio Grande or 14 year old girls from being sold But it won t either through incompetence or worse by design I yield the floor
892	Mr. Speaker I had the opportunity this month to make a trip down to the southern border And this was not my first trip down to that southern border And I will have to say that I found our Border Patrol more discouraged than ever before And I looked at it and I really kind of used it as a basis for comparison every time I go down there whether I am in California or Arizona or Texas just talking with them and hearing where they are and what they are seeing and what their experiences are on the border every single day And many of them feel like their job is an impossible task And this trip I was in the Del Rio sector in Texas and had the opportunity to also talk with the Texas military that is down there on the border with the Texas DPS They are down there on the border working And there at Eagle Pass is where so many people are crossing into the country And one of the things that they pointed out was they really can t stop this flow because basically the Biden administration has told them they can t stop this flow So we did a little checking into what has actually transpired since Joe Biden went into office And according to the Migration Policy Institute which is not a conservative group by any means it is a more liberal policy think tank in Joe Biden s first 100 days he took 94 Executive actions that undermined the job that the Border Patrol is trying to do on that southern border So think about this You are in service to your country and the Commander in Chief is taking actions that make your job the job that you have taken an oath to do making that job harder to do harder to execute your job Well now those who believe in open border policy they think that taking 94 Executive actions to make it easier for people to illegally enter the country they would see that as a good thing But those of us who are constitutionalists those of us who really believe in the rule of law those of us who want our Nation to have an immigration policy that honors the rule of law we look at that and we say 94 Executive actions take a branch of this government an Agency of this government and makes it more difficult for them to do their job Now many of my colleagues across the aisle have been no help in getting this situation at the border under control They have voted to keep sending checks basically to those who illegally enter the country They have approved a payday a massive payday a lot of funding going out to many of these sanctuary cities And in 2022 Democrats voted to expand the Biden administration s catch and release policy This is people who are apprehended at the border and then they kind of get a checkmark They get a plane ticket or a bus ticket to somewhere in the country and are told to show up on a date maybe 2 years in the future and have their asylum claim heard What they have also done my Democratic friends across the aisle is they have voted against giving Border Patrol the funding that they need to control the chaos that that policy has created So to many of us it seems like things are backward they are upside down There should be agreement that we are going to honor the rule of law There should be agreement that we are going to protect our sovereignty There should be agreement that our border will be closed There should be agreement that we are going to fund the Border Patrol There should be agreement that we are going to fund ICE There should be agreement that we are going to fund title 42 that we are going to fund building the border wall and that we are going to fund additional screening for dangerous narcotics like fentanyl But that has not been the case So open border yes But also according to Border Patrol what we have in this country with this administration is a lawless border policy That is right a lawless border policy And here is the reason for that That was not said lightly But it has become the reality because of the intentionality of this administration to leave that border open to pass those Executive actions a President 94 Executive actions that make it more difficult for Border Patrol to do their job 94 That is what you call intentional That is what you call undermining what should be the policy and the support on the southern border for our Border Patrol Now if you want to look at it on a month by month basis December Let s take just the month of December Traditionally you don t have as many people crossing in December but because we have seen the border open and the You all come sign hanging out on that border you have people coming across that border in record numbers In Yuma AZ they said they had people from 176 different countries speaking 200 different languages coming across that border In the month of December alone there were 250 000 a quarter million illegal encounters These are the ones that the Border Patrol was able to apprehend They are the ones who touch U S soil raise their hands and say We claim asylum 250 000 And over the past 2 years there have been more than 4 1 million illegal border crossings This is a record And you have the got aways the known got aways that you can see on surveillance but you can t get to them And as Border Patrol will tell you the really bad guys the really really bad guys the unknown got aways they are the ones they don t see but they are slipping into the country How do they know they are here They find what they drop when they come across the river They find clothes and shoes carpet shoes They see tracks They see cars that come and pick these individuals up Do we have criminals coming into this country Absolutely we do In Eagle Pass they told us that in the first 3 months of this fiscal year in fiscal 2023 they apprehended 143 convicted criminals Now these are people who had committed felonies whether it is rape or armed robbery or manslaughter These are people with a criminal record Last year in 2022 they apprehended 98 terrorists They have apprehended dozens of gang members MS 13 gang members And the thing that is so critical about this is that these individuals don t stay in Yuma or El Paso or Eagle Pass That is where they come across and they are ending up in your towns They are ending up in Wisconsin They are ending up in Tennessee my beloved State I was talking with a police chief from Tennessee before I came over here In rural Tennessee the vast majority of the drugs they apprehend are either fentanyl or fentanyl laced They are using Narcan more than they ever thought they would need to use Narcan TBI told us last month that the cartel is active in Tennessee Last week I was visiting with a police chief from another city there in my State and he said Oh it is not only active in the State it is active right here in our town He talked about some of the loss of life So as we discuss what is happening at the border we have to look at the humanitarian crisis there Yes everybody coming across that border they will pay the cartel Now think about that They paid 5 000 7 000 10 000 whatever is the going rate They are flying into places like Mexicali Mexico and then they are coming across the border Cartels are global organizations now They are Big Business Human trafficking is a 13 billion a year business It has grown in the last few years from a 500 million a year business to a 13 billion a year business All of this ends up in our communities Indeed every town is a border town Every State is a border State right now because of this lawless border policy that is taking place at our southern border When you talk to the Border Patrol they will tell you that there is a way to get this under control Was it better under the previous administration Yes The numbers were down They did not see as many crossings because people understood that we were going to do some basic things We were going to enforce the law We were going to eliminate and we did eliminate the incentives for people to come We had Remain in Mexico We ended catch and release We had title 42 And we were doing what the Border Patrol has said for three decades they need a physical barrier People commonly called it Build the wall And wherever a wall could be built there was a plan to build it and they were working on it And having people working on that border made certain that you didn t have those border crossings Border Patrol has also said that they need better surveillance because right now the cartels have better technology than our Border Patrol Think about this With the cartels multinational big business you don t cross the border any way shape or form sex trafficking human trafficking gangs drug trafficking Nobody and nothing comes across that border without the cartel getting their cut That is what is happening and our Border Patrol is saying Here is what we need There is a way to fix this We can fix this issue The Border Patrol says Look let us enforce the laws that are on the books We have immigration laws Let s enforce them So you see why it is frustrating to them when you have a President and a Department of Homeland Security and the President is signing 94 Executive actions that make it harder for them to do their job It defies common sense Eliminate the monetary incentives that are out there The cartel feels like they have a great business model They get people to the border People raise their hands claim asylum Then the U S taxpayer picks up the tab buys them a plane ticket a bus ticket and gets them wherever they are wanting to go in the country When was the last time the Federal Government did something like that for you Wherever you want to go we will give you a ticket We will get you there We will provide you food housing shelter Look at those economic incentives and remove those As I said Remain in Mexico building the wall those are things that the Border Patrol those are the things that people who live on the border tell us need to be done I was down here earlier this week talking about this trip and talked about a visit I had at a ranch It was out in Uvalde I met with people from Kinney County TX and from Uvalde and some ranchers some farmers some business owners Right now with this border policy it is making it very difficult for them to ranch Some of them have cattle on their ranches The migrants come in They cut fences So they are bearing that cost of fences Some are farmers with watermelons lettuce and cabbage and their fields are getting torn up Pecan orchards are being run through And they are saying Help us One rancher looked at me and he said Marsha how long can we continue this and what is the endgame Because he has people who die and they end up on his ranch he finds it hard to do their cattle business We need to think carefully about this The Border Patrol has said these are steps that would stop the chaos This would bring some law and order back to the southern border but the Biden administration is going to have to say We got this policy wrong We need to take these steps We need to honor the service of the Border Patrol We need to respect the people who live and work on this border We need to make certain that we build that wall that we secure this area I yield the floor I suggest the absence of a quorum
893	Mr President this is becoming a regular appearance on the Senate floor to talk about Social Security It is something that most Americans think that Congress supports almost unanimously It is a program that has been with us President Roosevelt on August 14 1935 signed the Social Security Act Out of that came Medicare when a Democratic Congress in 1965 with President Johnson s signature signed it We know what Medicare means We know what Social Security means for people who live longer healthier lives No matter your income no matter if you have been a Senator for 20 years no matter if you are a CEO no matter if you are a UAW member and at a Ford plant in Avon no matter if you are a low income worker at the Hilton Hotel on West Market in Akron no matter your work you are eligible at a certain age for Social Security and Medicare So what is the debate about Well the debate is philosophical and I am not even sure what It is partly my conservative colleagues who generally want to privatize Medicare and Social Security For them it seems to be something philosophic or ideological or sometimes it is just people wanting to support the insurance industry because if you privatize Medicare and Social Security yes it will help the insurance companies yes it will help the banks If you privatize the VA like many want to do the Veterans Administration undermining what veterans have earned by serving their country it may help some private sector corporations It will help pad their bottom line It will help many CEOs make even more money but it is wrong When work has dignity people have a secure retirement veterans have benefits and pensions are protected Americans can count on Medicare and count on Social Security A secure retirement shouldn t be a partisan issue It wasn t a partisan issue particularly in the 1930s It is not a partisan issue to the American people I don t think you can tell a Republican from a Democrat who is 70 years old or 80 years old drawing Social Security and Medicare They know they have earned it They have paid into it for decades As I have said they have earned it It is one of the most unifying institutions in the country Americans want to protect Social Security and Medicare They want to make those programs stronger Americans do But elected officials far too many people on this side of the aisle as the Senator from Connecticut knows far too many people from this side of the aisle think that we should privatize those programs that they will be more efficient or some such philosophical jargon that they throw forward But we know what will happen insurance companies will make more money banks will make more money and people who have worked in this country and played by the rules all their lives get squeezed Today down the hall especially straight down the hall in the House of Representatives down there the Republicans are threatening in order to raise the debt limit the debt limit is simply we should pay our bills The Trump administration and all administrations have run this deficit up We should pay the bills That is what it is about They are refusing to pay the bills our Nation owes and they are saying that if we don t do what they want to do then they are going stop Social Security checks from going out They are going to try to privatize Social Security They want to take this country and the American economy to the brink of default They want to leverage their fiscal lunacy It really is leveraging their fiscal lunacy frankly to cut your Social Security It is that simple Then as I said there is privatizing Social Security The details differ The terms may change but the goal is the same I have been in the Senate now this is the beginning it is my 17th year Every couple of years a few of the wunderkinds on that side of the aisle want to try to find a way to privatize Social Security privatize Medicare and privatize the Veterans Administration It is nothing less than an attempt to go back on a bedrock promise Ms CORTEZ MASTO assumed the Chair The Senator from Nevada understands that people pay into Social Security every paycheck They tend to pay into Medicare every well that is not actually true If you are really really really rich you only pay into Social Security for the first part of the year because you have already paid enough for the year and it is some philosophy that I don t really understand But it is a bedrock promise to all of us You pay in you get those benefits Last year I introduced a resolution the Senator from Nevada cosponsored it affirming the Senate s commitment to protecting and expanding Social Security It was pretty simple It simply said we affirm we pledge we will protect Social Security and Medicare from any kinds of cuts from the far right that doesn t believe in the program Almost every Democrat signed on Not one Republican signed on Not one Republican committed to our promise recommitted to our promise to the American people that if you work hard all your life Social Security will be there for you So Americans shouldn t have to worry that politicians secure with their government pensions are going to try to take away their retirement I urge my colleagues to do what the American people want us to do overwhelmingly They want us to protect and expand Social Security and Medicare As I said just look down the hall in the House of Representatives There is a new majority there a new majority controlled by the far right of what used to be a pretty centrist Republican Party from the far right that whenever they try to privatize Social Security and Medicare they get all kinds of contributions from the rightwing and from Wall Street and from some big healthcare companies and some big energy companies and all that and it is wrong We know it is wrong Whether it is Nevada whether it is Las Vegas or Cleveland whether it is Reno or Columbus whether it is Carson City or Dayton we know that overwhelmingly people in this country want a strong Social Security that will always be there for our kids and our grandkids and our great grandkids They want a Medicare that will provide healthcare to people regardless of your wealth regardless of your income regardless of your station in life That is my pledge I know the Senators on the floor from Connecticut and Nevada also support that commitment and pledge It is where we are as a country It is not unfortunately where some of my colleagues sit Mr. Speaker I yield the floor
894	Mr. Speaker this week the country has been riveted again by scenes of mass shootings this time in California I spoke on the phone to my seatmate Senator Padilla just a few days ago and it is a conversation that I have had with the Presiding Officer It is a conversation I have had with Senators from Colorado and Virginia We all now increasingly come from States where we have seen dozens of people murdered at one time in these horrific horrific mass shootings I am proud that in the wake of the Uvalde massacre and the shooting in Buffalo last summer this Congress came together and finally passed after 30 years of inaction legislation that begins to make our communities safer but what we saw in Monterey and Half Moon Bay is just confirmation reaffirmation that we have enormous work to do Let me first tell you the good news and that is this The legislation we passed last summer the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act is saving lives as we speak If you recall that legislation set up a new background check process for younger buyers of weapons in this country It eliminated the boyfriend loophole so that no domestic abusers in this country can get their hands on weapons It gave funding to States to set up red flag laws It strengthened our background check system It is a set of really important changes A bipartisan group of us went out to West Virginia just a few weeks ago Senator Cornyn Senator Tillis Senator Capito three Republicans and myself and Senator Manchin to see the background check system at work We went out and sat right next to the background checks operators in their cubicles and we watched them process these new background checks that are required because of the law we passed We got briefings from the FBI in which they laid out for us the details of incredibly dangerous individuals individuals who were in crisis many of them under 21 who would have gotten a weapon in their moment of crisis had it not been for the legislation we passed I also saw how diligent these background checks operators were how serious they were about their job how proud they were of their job because they knew that in their hands they held the safety of the American public that every time they click that button there was an individual walking out of the store with a gun and they wanted to make sure of two things First they were protecting the American public make sure that only those who were qualified under the law who weren t deemed to be too dangerous were getting those weapons The second thing they were concerned about and every single one of them told us this they were there to uphold the Second Amendment as well They were there to make sure to make sure of the guarantee that if you are a law abiding citizen you can get a legal weapon I think all of us who visited were really impressed by the work that our background checks operators do and were confident that the bill we passed last summer is saving lives as we speak But everybody in this country knows it is not enough Everybody in this country knows it was just a start I hope this year we will be able to build on the progress we made last year to find additional common ground because what you are seeing in California and what you have seen all across the country are individuals largely men mostly younger men whose brains are breaking and in that moment of crisis they are reaching for a weapon they are seeing their path to exorcise those demons as running through an episode of mass slaughter But it is important to note that this is not the only country in the world where brains break This is not the only country in the world where people have paranoias This is not the only country in the world with severe mental illness So the story of American mass murder is not a story of mental illness it is not a story of paranoia it is not a story of grudge or grievance because every other country has that But only in the United States does that grudge grievance paranoia and mental illness lead to mass assassination That is because in this country we are flooded with weapons and not just any weapons but weapons of mass destruction These killers they use the same set of weapons semiautomatic weapons with attachable clips that can fire 300 bullets out of 1 cartridge They all use the same set of weapons because they are trying to kill as many people as quickly as possible Only in this country can those individuals who have decided to take out their anger their grudge and their grievance through mass murder get their hands on a weapon that will allow them to do that Other countries don t allow that to happen I have told this story many times before but on the same day that Sandy Hook occurred there was an equal number of students attacked in a school in Henan Province China Every kid who was shot in Sandy Hook died Why I won t describe it for you on the floor today but the damage that a bullet fired from an AR 15 does to the body of a little child is irrevocable It literally tears you apart the bullet is going so fast through your body So none of those kids survived But in Henan Province China every child who was attacked survived Why Because in Henan Province the attacker who was just as unhinged likely as the attacker in Sandy Hook had a knife and not a gun Knives can do damage too but not as much damage as an AR 15 So States that are more serious about keeping assault weapons off the streets and guns away from dangerous people have a lot less gun crime a lot less Countries that are more serious about making sure that people who have these grudges grievances and paranoias don t get their hands on dangerous weapons they have almost rock bottom levels of gun violence I think we are at a moment in time where Americans know this Americans are sick and tired of the status quo That is why we were able to pass this law last summer It was a start a really important start but it was not a result of any of the advocates in the Senate perfecting their argument it was a result of parents and students and families out there in America compelling Congress to do something because this country has had enough This country has not just had enough of the mass shootings but of the hundred plus people who die every day from gunshot wounds suicides accidental shootings homicides all of which can be prevented through limiting the access by dangerous people or people who are going through a crisis to weaponry and particularly weaponry of mass destruction So I think that message from the American public we heard last summer it is not going away The good news is we found common ground And right now in the U S Congress you have no choice if you want to get something done but to find common ground We found it I don t think that anybody who voted for it paid any substantial political price I think there was only political upside to supporting a compromise that was wildly popular If you remember Senator McConnell showed a PowerPoint presentation to the Republican caucus in May of last year and showed his Republican colleagues how popular all of the things that we voted on last summer were red flag laws stopping domestic abusers from getting guns no political downside in continuing to make progress when it comes to making our communities safer As we live amidst another moment in American history where the country is recognizing the unique problem of mass shootings as we think about 20 some odd days gone in the year with 40 mass shootings already when we think about the fear that our kids live in when they go to school wondering whether they will be next and now the fear that workplaces have and churchgoers have of whether they will be next it is more reason for us to make 2023 a year in which we don t follow the pre 2022 precedent of doing nothing but we follow the 2022 precedent of finding the common ground between Republicans and Democrats to make this country safer I yield the floor
895	Mr. Speaker I rise today to honor the life of Walter Ulloa a trailblazing figure in the media and entertainment industry a role model to many in California and my personal friend Walter grew up in Brawley CA at a time when Latinos were still segregated in his community He graduated from the University of Southern California in 1970 before earning his law degree from Loyola School of Law in 1975 After earning his degrees Walter embarked on what would become a nearly five decade career in media playing a pivotal role in the growth of Spanish language television and radio across the United States At KMEX in Los Angeles there were some early signs that Walter s work ethic intellect and mind for media would make him successful During his 13 years there he worked as operations manager production manager news director local sales manager and account executive before venturing out to create his own projects In 1996 he cofounded Entravision a now global Latino media marketing and technology company For over 25 years he served as chairman and chief executive officer at Entravision where he grew his young company to own over 100 television and radio stations as well as digital platforms throughout the United States Whether in Los Angeles or across the country if you watched or listened to Spanish language media in the last five decades there is a very good chance you have Walter Ulloa to thank But away from his industry impact communities in California knew him for his generosity and his commitment to public service So respected was Walter for his expertise and appreciation of the arts that President Barack Obama appointed him to the board of trustees for the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts For more than 20 years I had the privilege of knowing and working with Walter I always admired how he generously gave his time and contributed resources to help increase Latino civic engagement and voting in California The fact that after growing up in a segregated community in the 1950s Walter could go on to not only an extraordinarily successful career but to help future Latino communities prosper time and time again is a testament to his character The life of Walter Ulloa is nothing less than the American dream come true from his educational and economic success his philanthropy and his service to our country He will be missed Angela and I send our love to his wife Alexandra Seros and son Bruno Seros Ulloa and to all those whose lives were touched by his service

Faucett Missouri a rural farming community in the northwestern part of the state Esther remembers getting paid 25 cents an hour while working on her family s plot of land After learning about an opportunity for high school students to study abroad in France Esther secured a loan from a bank in St Joseph Missouri to cover the costs of the foreign exchange program Representing her first meaningful visit to a local bank this experience sparked Esther s lifelong interest in banking and she soon began working at the institution while still in high school While earning her degree in Business Administration from Missouri Western State University Esther continued to work at the bank that had helped facilitate her trip to France thereby expanding her knowledge of community banking while gaining an even deeper appreciation for the ways in which well run banks can empower everyday people Making use of another bank loan Esther returned to Europe during her college years to study the finer points of international banking Made aware of job openings at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City through a newspaper ad Esther joined the Bank on April 5 1982 as a bank examiner trainee At the time of her hiring the banking industry was going through a period of relative stability This smooth sailing however gave way to rough and stormy seas when the failure of a bank in Oklahoma City initiated a financial crisis whose waves of volatility crashed most violently against the Federal Reserve s 10th District where Esther had begun working just 3 months earlier This baptism by fire made clear the importance of the Federal Reserve s role in safeguarding America s financial system and Esther quickly began rising up the ranks Promoted 3 times by 1984 the young banker worked

915	Mr Speaker today I am introducing the Northern Mariana Islands Population Stabilization Act The bill is intended to bolster our nation s strategic interests in the Western Pacific by maintaining the population and prosperity of the Marianas the district I represent The Marianas is part of the chain of U S and U S affiliated islands that faces Chinese expansion in the region Through the Marianas the U S controls an ocean area of 289 000 square miles greater than the size of Texas Yet the U S presence here is at risk According to the 2020 decennial census the population of the Marianas declined by 12 2 percent since the 2010 census This is the second largest decline among all states and non state areas of our Nation over that 10 year period This population erosion and the loss of economic viability that results occurs against the backdrop of increased competition with China in the Western Pacific a time when the United States needs to be strengthening our position in the region not shrinking in significance There are many reasons why people are leaving the Marianas There are better public services and greater economic opportunity in the mainland United States The anxiety stemming from the repeated and hyperdestructive typhoons associated with accelerating climate change also factors in the decision to leave I refer Members to the article People are fleeing Puerto Rico Guam and every other U S territory What gives in the Washington Post edition of September 23 2022 for a discussion of population loss in all the U S insular areas The article Perfect Storm When is it time to abandon a place to climate change in Harpers Magazine s October 2022 edition tracks the decision of one family in the Marianas to leave their home to escape the impacts of climate change Population decline whether in the islands or in rural areas of the continental United States creates a negative feedback loop Reduced tax revenues limit the ability of local governments to improve services And the reduced consumer base and labor pool throttle business You can see this affect in the drop in Gross Domestic Product in the Marianas GDP fell 11 2 percent in 2019 the most recent available data a decline that would have been even more severe but for the COVID related relief that Congress provided The Northern Mariana Islands Population Stabilization Act builds on several laws enacted during the Trump administration and on previous action by the House In the 116th Congress we passed this same legislation by voice vote without dissent It allows certain longterm foreign workers and investors already lawfully present in the islands to apply for permanent status in the Marianas only Previously President Trump had approved USPL 115 218 defining these long term workers and signed USPL 116 24 creating the Marianas only resident status The Marianas only resident status that President Trump sanctioned provides no eligibility for public assistance It bars entry into any other part of the United States except for purpose of transit through Guam to a non U S destination The status President Trump approved is revocable in case of communicable disease criminal conviction or terrorist activity Making this Marianas only status available simply encourages continued residence and employment by people already lawfully present and gainfully employed and doing so would help to stabilize the population in our islands After the House approved the legislation I have introduced today in the 116th Congress the Senate took no action In the intervening years the population eligible for Marianas only status which by definition cannot increase has shrunk from 2 600 to 1 600 underscoring the continuing flight and the urgent need for us to act In this time of heightened concern about spending I do want to remind the House that the Congressional Budget Office determined in 2019 this legislation has negligible effect on direct spending That assessment must remain the same in 2023 as the number of affected individuals has only declined I ask all Members to support this simple straightforward response to the problem of population loss in the Marianas It is not a total solution but acknowledgement a problem exists and must be addressed I ask too that Members see the Northern Mariana Islands Population Stabilization Act as an important component of our larger national response to the continuing Chinese expansion occurring throughout the Pacific

923	Mr. Speaker right here in our Nation s Capital crime continues to soar at an alarming rate Yet the D C Council is determined to advance a severely misguided bill to reduce penalties for violent criminal offenses In fact some of the very crimes that the D C Council included in their radical legislation are on the rise For example last year robberies were up vehicle theft increased by 8 percent and carjackings skyrocketed by 14 percent Yet the D C Council is fighting to reduce yes reduce penalties for these offenses You just can t make this stuff up Now to her credit D C Mayor Bowser opposes this dangerous effort correctly claiming This bill does not make us safer For once I agree with Mayor Bowser because combating crime and protecting citizens is not a conservative issue it is a commonsense issue it is an American issue In the face of D C s failed leadership Congress must take immediate action to prevent this disastrous bill from emboldening criminals and threatening the safety of residents and visitors In the coming weeks I will introduce a joint resolution of disapproval to stop this insanity in its tracks I look forward to leading this fight and I urge all of my colleagues Republican and Democrat to join me so we can ensure that no American faces fear and violence in our Nation s Capital Defense of Americans Second Amendment Freedoms
924	Mr. Speaker I rise today in the defense of Americans Second Amendment freedoms The Biden administration is moving forward with yet another gun grabbing tactic in order to register and ban millions of firearms moving one step closer to the left s ultimate goal of disarming our Nation and dismantling our Second Amendment freedoms Earlier this month the ATF finalized an unconstitutional rule pertaining to firearms with stabilizing braces Under the ATF s new rule any pistol braced firearm would be considered an illegal short barreled rifle making these guns subject to the draconian regulations under the National Firearms Act of 1934 Let me be clear Unelected anti gun bureaucrats at the ATF do not have the authority to make laws That authority rests right here in Congress Congress cannot continue turning a blind eye to the Biden administration s weaponization of the National Firearms Act and ongoing assault on Americans Second Amendment freedoms The time to act is now and I am proud to lead this fight Next week I will re introduce the Stop Harassing Owners of Rifles Today Act or the SHORT Act to repeal elements of the National Firearms Act thereby prohibiting the ATF from registering and banning pistols with stabilizing braces Additionally as soon as the ATF s unlawful rule is published to the Federal Register I will introduce a Resolution of Disapproval under the Congressional Review Act to override the Biden administration s unlawful overreach I have always done my utmost in the defense of our constitutional right to keep and bear arms It is now time now that the House is under the Republican majority to go on offense Mr. Speaker I want gun owners to hear me loud and clear We are fighting for you and your Second Amendment freedoms and we will never give up Lawlessness at the Southern Border
925	Mr. Speaker I rise today to highlight the lawlessness happening at our southern border To no one s surprise President Biden attempted to conceal the ongoing chaos chaos created by his disastrous policies at the southern border by releasing the latest CBP report on a Friday night news dump But these tactics can t hide the truth Last month over a quarter of a million over 251 000 illegal aliens were apprehended at the southern border making December the highest monthly total on record More than a quarter of a million in a single month If that doesn t pressure the Biden administration to fix this crisis what will In a dangerous addition 17 suspected terrorists were caught illegally crossing the border in December bringing the total number of individuals to 38 who were on the terrorist watch list and caught at the southern border in just the first 3 months of fiscal year 2023 How many suspected terrorists have to cross the southern border before the Biden administration will take this border crisis seriously To make matters worse CBP has already seized over 9 000 pounds of fentanyl so far this fiscal year which is enough to kill more than 2 billion people over 6 times the population of the United States When will the Biden administration finally put an end to the wide open southern border that allows this deadly drug from China to devastate our communities While the White House willfully destroys our southern border and subsequently demolishes our national security House Republicans are determined to secure the border and put Americans first Part of that commitment is ensuring that every solitary individual responsible for this self inflicted crisis will be held accountable starting with Secretary Mayorkas whose impeachment is long overdue Without accountability Americans will not have the safe and secure Nation they deserve
926	Mr. Speaker I rise today to bring attention to the storm damage impacting Alabama s Seventh Congressional District following the devastating tornadoes that struck our State earlier this month On January 12 severe storms including multiple tornadoes tore through the Southeast ravaging communities in Alabama Mississippi Georgia and destroying over 16 000 homes In my district alone 6 000 properties sustained damage many to the point of irreversible repair Across Alabama s Black Belt rural communities that were still recovering from financial ruin of COVID 19 were once again devastated Hale County with less than 15 000 residents lost over 92 homes with an estimated 2 million worth of damage Greene County and Sumter County also in my district sustained damage Just outside of my district in Autauga County seven precious lives were lost that day In my beloved hometown of Selma Alabama an EF 3 tornado tore through the town center leveling homes businesses churches and community centers in the Queen City I spent much of last week in Selma boots on the ground to survey the damage and to assist with the recovery effort I will never ever forget the scene as I entered Selma that evening It was pitch black as I crossed the bridge no lights just street after street of complete devastation The following morning I was joined by Governor Ivey Senator Britt Selma Mayor James Perkins and State and local officials to tour the wreckage My heart broke to see the depth of destruction in the light trees uprooted from the ground homes destroyed lives destroyed It is not lost on me that this devastation struck our community on MLK weekend But despite the debris and the horrific scenes that we saw I did see a vision of what Dr King meant by a beloved community I saw neighbor helping neighbor and community members lending a hand to take care of the place that we call home I am thankful that President Biden heard our cries and expedited a major disaster declaration for the State of Alabama This designation will provide critical Federal resources I am endlessly grateful to our partners at FEMA who are on the ground right now helping my constituents Today the Alabama congressional delegation is sending a letter to President Biden requesting an increase in disaster assistance to Alabama increasing the Federal share to 100 percent of the total eligible costs We need this We need this desperately I also thank the many mayors and residents of surrounding communities who offered a helping hand We are indeed resilient people in Alabama s Seventh Congressional District and nothing about that will change Out of this destruction I know that we have a unique opportunity to reimagine Selma and surrounding areas and to build back better and stronger than before We will do all we can working together at all levels of government to bring every resource at our disposal to those who have been affected This evening at 6 30 Central Time I will be hosting a live telephone townhall about disaster assistance to answer questions and for my constituents to hear directly from FEMA and the Alabama EMA on disaster assistance I am asking my colleagues to keep Alabama s Seventh Congressional District and all of Alabama that was affected in your thoughts and prayers as we recover and rebuild But for the grace of God go all of us We do need to make sure that our Federal resources are adequate to help those who have been impacted by disasters We are indeed Selma Strong
927	Mr. Speaker another month and another record as the crisis at our southern border has gotten worse Under President Biden and Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas watch the Federal Government has completely ceded control of our border to Mexican drug cartels Yet time and time again Secretary Mayorkas has repeatedly claimed that the border is secure Well the facts tell a different story Late last Friday CBP reported that December 2022 had the highest number of illegal crossings at our southern border ever recorded over 251 000 illegal migrant encounters in just 1 month In fiscal year 2022 we saw a record breaking 98 people on the terrorist watch list attempt to cross the border Since October we are already on track to break that number with 38 people caught trying to illegally come into the interior of our country How many more suspected terrorists have to cross over the border for this administration to take the crisis seriously CBP seized over 9 000 pounds of deadly fentanyl that the cartels attempted to smuggle across our border That is enough to kill over 2 billion innocent lives Mr. Speaker it is far past time that we hold the Biden administration accountable for its complete dereliction of duty to secure our borders That is why I am glad that next week Chairman Jordan and the House Judiciary Committee will be holding the first of many hearings on this crisis Secretary Mayorkas has completely abused his authority and ignored the United States immigration laws Questions are coming I hope the Secretary clears his calendar because we have a lot and I look forward to getting answers to those questions Congratulating Riverheads High School Football Team
928	Mr. Speaker I rise to recognize Augusta County s own Riverheads High School football team for winning the Virginia Class 1 State football championship this year This was the Gladiators 10th State title in the program s history A 21 7 halftime lead helped propel the team to a resounding 49 27 victory over George Wythe High School Riverheads has now won a notable seven consecutive State titles and junior running back Cayden Cook Cash who led the team with 282 rushing yards said People had doubted us I think we proved them wrong Cayden and his teammates sure did that The Riverheads running game had been strong all season which allowed the Gladiators to catch the George Wythe Maroons off guard with an impressive seven touchdowns culminating in an all around unstoppable offense When asked how it felt to take home the title once more Head Coach Ray Norcross said Our kids played hard and played well and we did enough to win Indeed every State championship is earned not given and this squad certainly earned it finishing out the season with a 12 1 record Congratulations to all the Riverheads players coaches staff and fans on this incredible accomplishment
929	Mr. Speaker I rise in recognition of Mother Willa Cash a resident of Detroit and community mother in Michigan s 12th Congressional District as we mourn her recent passing She was lovingly called Willie by those who knew her well Ms Cash s work touched the lives of so many She worked for the State of Michigan s Department of Unemployment Services and later the Michigan Department of Human Services before retiring in 1999 after 26 years of service Ms Cash was a caring compassionate leader in our community She volunteered her time and energy to the Unity Temple Church of Detroit and Greenwich Park Association block club She was a proud lifelong engaged voter and a member retiree of the United Auto Workers Region 1 A Ms Cash s love and compassion for her family were extraordinary Willie and her late husband James were married 53 years at the time of his passing and they were parents of two beautiful twins Please join me in recognizing Mother Willa Cash and her contribution to our community as we honor her memory Detroit s Water Shutoff Moratorium
930	Mr. Speaker just over 3 weeks ago the city of Detroit s water shutoff moratorium ended terminating vital protection for Detroit s most vulnerable residents We only got the lifesaving moratorium in the first place thanks to years of determined organizing and advocacy from our community s water warriors Many are the mothers of our neighborhoods In response to that organizing and advocacy the city has now created an affordability plan but many of the mothers in our community and advocates continue to highlight shortcomings and a lack of awareness amongst struggling Detroiters of the resources available which leaves thousands still in jeopardy of shutoffs For many Americans water shutoffs are only the beginning Even after they pay off outstanding debt or arrange for payment plans reconnection fees further penalize them We need to move beyond treating missed payments as a moral failing and acknowledge the reality of families struggling as they try to make ends meet The cost of water in our country has gone up 400 percent In the wealthiest Nation on Earth there should not be a single family without water We have had enough of punishing people for being poor It is time to take our public health seriously and guarantee water as a human right We all know water is life It is time we start treating it as such In Solidarity with Iranian Protesters
931	Mr. Speaker I rise today in solidarity with the protesters in Iran In the streets they are demanding human rights and women s equality The courageous protesters are risking their lives to stop the massive policing and security operations hurting women No one protesting for human rights in Iran or anywhere in the United States or anywhere in the world should be met with government violence No one should be persecuted or executed for fighting for freedom for their sisters their daughters or their mothers from oppressive and harmful actions Mahsa Amini should be alive today Countless protesters should be alive today I stand and I know we all do with all the brave and courageous Iranians especially the young women at the forefront of this movement who are fighting for liberation and bodily autonomy
932	Mr. Speaker I rise today to honor a man who devoted his life to the service and protection of our Nation Judge Harold Murphy Born in Felton Georgia in 1927 Judge Murphy attended West Georgia College before serving in the Navy toward the end of World War II He resumed his studies at the University of Mississippi and the University of Georgia s School of Law where he graduated in 1949 He began a law practice in Haralson County Georgia and in 1950 was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives as the youngest member at that time Judge Murphy served five consecutive terms before stepping down in 1961 to focus on practicing law In 1971 Judge Murphy was appointed by Governor Jimmy Carter to the Superior Court for the Tallapoosa Judicial Circuit Following his election in 1976 President Carter nominated Judge Murphy to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia He was confirmed by the Senate on July 28 1977 For 45 years he served his country on the Federal bench and became an acclaimed jurist and legal icon with a stellar reputation that extended far beyond Georgia He always displayed a quick wit and a keen sense of humor was kind and empathetic and treated all those who appeared before him with courtesy and respect Judge Murphy once subpoenaed a talking myna bird who had witnessed a store robbery to testify in court Judge Murphy s humor was only surpassed by his fairness and prudential impartiality In fact he is the only judge that was known to receive Christmas cards from inmates in prison that Judge Murphy himself had put away He was so excruciatingly fair and impartial that during one case he even talked the defendant out of a guilty plea Judge Murphy worked tirelessly and carried a full docket until the age of 90 when he took senior judge status in the Northern District of Georgia He continued to preside over cases until his death on December 28 2022 Judge Murphy received many professional awards and recognitions including from the State Bar of Georgia and the University of Georgia School of Law In 2014 Alabama State University renamed its graduate school after Judge Murphy in recognition of his landmark ruling in Knight v Alabama a long running case that the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals asked him to handle involving the vestiges of racial segregation then present in the Alabama University system Above all else Judge Murphy was a loving and devoted husband and father and a strong role model who made everyone who knew him in northwest Georgia proud The daily sight of Judge Murphy leading his gaggle of clerks to lunch on Broad Street will be deeply missed by the community in Rome that he loved so much and that loved him back The people of the 14th District of Georgia therefore urge the House to pass this bill to name the building at 600 East First Street in Rome Georgia the Harold L Murphy Federal Building and United States Courthouse

934	Mr. Speaker for too long the Biden administration has surrendered control of our Nation s southern border to members of the cartels and other bad actors who seek to do this great Nation harm This inaction by the Biden administration has allowed an untold number of illegal migrants drug smugglers and human traffickers to cross into our country with ease Many of these illegal entrants bring anarchy to our streets by committing violent crimes and help fuel America s drug crisis by smuggling in dangerous narcotics such as fentanyl Since Joe Biden has taken office over 4 7 million illegal immigrants have been apprehended at our southern border representing a 500 percent increase in border crossings since 2020 While many have been apprehended thousands of migrants have evaded capture by Federal authorities including 70 000 known got aways in December of 2022 alone These migrants remain unaccounted for and now are free to roam the streets of our cities and towns endangering the lives of innocent Americans In fact earlier this month four migrants who were bused to New York from the southern border were arrested on Long Island after stealing thousands of dollars in merchandise from a store in my district Thanks to the hard work of the Nassau County Police Department they were apprehended Unfortunately in New York Democrats have put criminals ahead of law abiding citizens and those individuals were released once again to wreak havoc on our communities While I am glad that these thieves were captured local law enforcement should not be forced to deal with the end result of Joe Biden s failed border policy If President Biden is serious about securing our border and preventing migrants from committing crimes like what happened in the Fourth Congressional District of New York he would stop underfunding Customs and Border Protection and treat our Border Patrol agents the way they should be treated and provide the agency the resources it needs to secure our borders here in America As a member of the Homeland Security Committee I fully intend to hold the President and Secretary Mayorkas accountable for their disastrous open border policies and seek solutions that safeguard this great Nation

939	Mr. Speaker today and tomorrow House Republicans are bringing the Strategic Production Response Act to the floor a bill that forces the administration to open up even more public lands and waters to drilling any time the President releases oils from the reserve in order to lower consumer gas prices Now what House Republicans are doing is effectively ending the President s authority to lower consumer gas prices while handing over our public lands and waters to Big Oil You might wonder why Republicans are pushing legislation that clearly hurts the American people and consumers To put it plainly they are simply crossing another item off the wish list of Big Oil It is a simple payback to the political campaign donors This legislation is not needed It is fabricated It is based on a lie Time after time year after year the fossil fuel industry lobbies to control and lock up more of our public lands and waters and it often comes at the expense of surrounding environmental justice communities I say it is built on a lie There are 9 000 permits on public land effectively for Big Oil to be able to drill access and extract There are 2 000 that are not being used There are 2 000 permits on our oceans and waters that at this point 75 percent of those permits are not being used which already affords them the opportunity to extract Frontline communities in this country carry a legacy of dumping activities that have endangered both the health and the quality of life of these communities Sadly Big Oil has a well documented and troubled history of concentrating their polluting projects such as pipelines and refineries in environmental justice communities including communities of color poor communities Tribal communities communities without political representation and a systemic discrimination in terms of the burden they carry All of this is documented It is documented in higher air pollution rates in those communities water pollution and contamination premature death higher incidence of cancer and other diseases that affect these communities more than any other Yet Republicans once again stand ready to do Big Oil s bidding this week If Republicans actually are interested in helping American families in the communities overburdened by oil industry pollution they would support the Environmental Justice For All Act We have been working on the Environmental Justice For All Act for over 3 years It was developed and shaped directly by EJ communities during an extensive engagement process This Act has many components but it s based on a simple principle All people have the right to clean air clean water and healthy local environments For too many across our Nation these rights are not yet realized The provisions in the Environmental Justice For All Act are about credible equitable access to parks and outdoor activities and opportunities for underserved communities Federal agencies will be required to meaningfully under NEPA engage any communities prior to any decision when proposing actions affecting an EJ community and it strengthens Tribal consultation and input opportunities The bill strengthens and restores civil rights protections for communities long facing greater environmental hazards on the bases of race color or national origin The bill brings transparency coordination and accountability from Federal agencies when they carry out activities affecting frontline communities I was proud to work with Representative McEachin who left us far too early to develop the Environmental Justice For All Act His legacy on this issue is his compassion that he brought to it his strength that he brought to it they continue to be the legacy and the motivation to secure environmental justice and work for this legislation I am proud to say that Representative Barbara Lee will now join as co lead on the Environmental Justice For All Act this session and now the legislation will be called the Donald McEachin Environmental Justice For All Act We are talking about basic rights We are not talking about anything extravagant anything that is not proven by fact These communities have been burdened time and time again by industry The legislation that we will be seeing today and tomorrow brought forth by the Republicans opens the door once again to unchecked unmonitored and unprotected actions that will negatively continue to affect these communities The environment climate the need for remediation and the need for involvement by all communities and the resolution of the issues we face around climate change requires that the environmental justice community long left off the discussion long ignored in the history of this Nation in the siting of projects and activities that have hurt those communities and those families needs to be at the table If my Republican colleagues indeed want to reward Big Oil for their support that they have given them it is time that they include all communities
940	Mr. Speaker I rise today not only for Half Moon Bay and Monterey Park but for Oakland Goshen and San Francisco for Dallas and for Houston for Red Springs High Point and Durham for Chicago and Rockford for Tunica Resorts for Baton Rouge Shreveport and New Orleans for Fort Pierce Sanford Homestead Ocala and Miami Gardens for Phoenix for St Louis for Cleveland and Columbus for Allentown Philadelphia for Minneapolis for Denver for Albany Georgia for Huntsville for Enoch for Baltimore for Dumfries and for Washington D C We are 26 days into the new year and in those 26 days there have been 40 mass shootings in our country That is 40 mass shootings 73 innocent Americans killed These were mothers fathers sons and daughters who should still be with us today My heart is broken for every single solitary one of them How much more heartbreak must our Nation endure How many more lives must we lose How many more times must we watch as another safe space another sanctuary another school or another celebration becomes a site for a shooting How many times must I come to the floor and make this plea Our moments of silence won t save a single solitary soul We have seen more mass shootings in the first month of 2023 than in any other January on record The new year should mark new beginnings new progress and new hope Instead we find ourselves moving backward In less than a month this year has become one defined by shock and sorrow Every other country in the developed world has managed to rein in gun violence In 1996 Australia enacted commonsense firearm regulations following a mass shooting and gun deaths were cut in half In the U K just one school shooting pushed the government to pass lifesaving gun violence prevention measures New Zealand banned assault weapons almost immediately after the Christchurch massacre Where our peer nations choose to act America chooses to stand by in the face of tragedy after tragedy after tragedy A safer America is possible We can end the gun violence epidemic We can build a culture of rational reasonable and responsible firearm ownership We can ban the weapons of war used in so many mass shootings In fact we have done it in the past From 1994 to 2004 the United States banned assault weapons During that time gun deaths plummeted but they shot right back up as soon as the ban was lifted We have the resources and the precedent to do that again What we need is the political will Ending gun violence is not an issue of can t It is an issue of won t My Republican colleagues won t ban assault weapons they won t ban large magazines and they won t pass universal background checks The gun violence epidemic is a stain upon the fabric of our Nation and that stain grows deeper every second that Congress chooses not to pass substantial gun violence prevention legislation Last year we did take a key step in the right direction by passing the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act But make no mistake Mr. Speaker That was the beginning and we cannot allow it to end there I am grateful that my colleague David Cicilline plans to reintroduce an assault weapons ban I too am choosing to act I will soon reintroduce my bill to stop online ammunition sales Mr. Speaker I stand here confident that my Democratic colleagues will stand behind this commonsense legislation From Sandy Hook to Uvalde from Monterey Park to Trenton New Jersey every mass shooting is a policy choice Democrats are prepared to choose better and I demand that my Republican colleagues do the same
941	Mr. Speaker this has been a bloody week in America It seems like every day we have woken up to news of another mass shooting starting with the one 5 days ago when a gunman armed with an assault pistol and high capacity magazine killed 11 Californians as they celebrated Lunar New Year Three weeks from now Valentine s Day will be the 15th anniversary of a mass shooting on the Northern Illinois University campus in DeKalb The shooter started firing at 3 06 p m By 3 11 p m just 5 minutes later he had taken his own life But not before firing off 55 rounds of ammunition killing 6 people and injuring another 21 In Parkland Florida on Valentine s Day they don t memorialize Northern Illinois University they memorialize the anniversary of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School That shooting lasted for 6 minutes 139 rounds were fired 17 people were killed and 17 were injured Six months from now on Independence Day folks in Highland Park Illinois will be memorializing the first anniversary of a mass shooting when 83 rounds were fired 7 people were killed and 48 were injured before the police who were present at the scene could even identify the location of the shooter We do not get our holidays back unless we act Too often this body has responded to these shootings with thoughts and prayers Prayers that the American people won t notice that some of my colleagues are putting the economic interests of gun manufacturers ahead of people s lives But every once in a while we do act I want to talk about what we are capable of when we are touched by the better angels of our nature To do that let s flash back to another Valentine s Day not that long ago Two Chicago gangs were fighting over narcotics turf One of them surprised the other and in a flash of bullets seven people were dead Chicagoans and Illinoisans Americans were outraged Yes these were gang members but they didn t deserve to die The Saint Valentine s Day Massacre was in 1929 It was when Al Capone s Italian gang killed seven members of Bugs Moran s Irish gang as whiskey bootleggers fought over drug turf And we acted That shooting led to the passage of the National Firearms Act that banned civilian access to fully automatic Tommy guns and any rifle with a barrel longer than 18 inches That law is still on the books today It saves lives and no one has ever claimed it was unconstitutional By the way Mr. Speaker if you weren t expecting that a story about Chicago gangs was going to be about White people I would like to thank you for attending today s class in critical race theory As that poet Ice Cube says You better check yourself But I digress Seven people died in 1929 and we acted Eleven people died on Lunar New Year 5 days ago There have been 40 mass shootings in the first 26 days of this year over 1 300 gun homicides in the United States this year and another 1 700 gun suicides I am proud that my State of Illinois has just passed an assault weapons ban It is time for this body to do the same I know I speak for all Americans when I say that I want to enjoy my next holiday without fear of getting shot and that inaction in the wake of way too many avoidable deaths is completely unacceptable
942	Mr Speaker I rise today for the first time during this 118th Congress to call for unity and bipartisan action in this Congress This is a call that echoes across this House from commonsense Republicans and Democrats who are ready to focus on what unites us rather than what divides us It is a call that echoes across my district in the State of Nevada from independent minded folks who are tired of Congress playing games and politics as usual It is a call that echoes across the entire country In November every one of us in this Chamber won the support of our constituents and the trends were clear Extremism is out and real results are in Last Congress was different Democrats had control of the House the Senate and the Presidency but we didn t close the door on our Republican colleagues Instead we brought them to the table and led together to deliver results for all Americans and the track record shows it The bipartisan PACT Act now law protecting healthcare for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits and Agent Orange The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act now law the first major gun safety action in decades The bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act now law increasing our economic edge in a global economy and ensuring that we make more of everything in America And of course the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act now law the investment of a generation in every corner of this country roads bridges ports airports internet access water solutions for the West and so much more These accomplishments are significant and they will stand the test of time because we brought Democrats and Republicans together to make them happen Voters defied midterm predictions recognizing that Democrats deliver by putting people over politics and joining hands with our commonsense colleagues across the aisle but the work continues What we can work on together will always outweigh what holds us apart We all want to tackle inflation We all recognize the need to address the historic drought and to secure future water supplies for all Americans We all want to fix our broken immigration system to build one that strengthens our security without compromising our values as a nation of immigrants Congress is at our best when we put policy first and politics last That is what the American people want Congratulating Rebel Girls Company
943	Mr Speaker I rise today to congratulate the UNLV Rebel Girls Company dance team for winning yet another national championship title This program is no stranger to success and this makes eight wins for the university in the last 15 years This time they even achieved a 99 1 the highest hip hop score in program history Coming from the entertainment capital of the world the decorated dance team and crew have always represented Nevada well and their stellar performances have even dazzled audiences across the globe Their many titles are a reflection of the hard work of each and every person involved especially the leadership shown by Head Coach Marca DeCastroverde The past present and future of this program is so bright and I speak on behalf of all of Nevada as we continue to cheer them on Congratulations UNLV Rebel Girls Company on yet another success
944	Mr. Speaker Ronald Reagan was prescient in his description of Congress especially as Congress addresses issues most specifically the debt ceiling Here is what Ronald Reagan had to say about Congress Congress consistently brings government to the edge of default before facing its responsibility This brinkmanship threatens the holders of government bonds and those who rely on Social Security and veterans benefits Let me repeat that those who rely on Social Security you could add Medicare and veterans benefits That is what is at stake here Reagan went on to say Interest rates would skyrocket instability would occur in the financial markets and the Federal deficit would soar Why then would our colleagues on the other side of the aisle hold the American economy hostage In their own words so they can cut Social Security and Medicare They call these programs entitlements For all of those listening to this make sure you call your Member of Congress and let them know that Social Security is not an entitlement It is an earned benefit It is something that people pay for weekly biweekly or monthly How do they know How do we trust and verify this All you have to do Mr. Speaker is go to your pay stub It says FICA That stands for Federal Insurance Contribution That is Federal Insurance Contribution Whose Yours the more than 66 million Americans who contribute to this program It is an earned benefit It is not an entitlement They clearly are entitled to their Social Security But here we have the ruse of the year We are going to hold the American economy hostage so that we can make cuts to a program that Congress hasn t enhanced in more than 52 years on our watch ours being every Member of Congress We cannot let this persist Fortunately because of hard work in the past seniors are receiving a COLA this year because of COVID But it has not been reformed it is not permanent and there hasn t been a benefit enhancement in 52 years In 1971 a loaf of bread cost 72 cents I don t have to go through the litany of how costs have risen With 10 000 baby boomers a day becoming eligible for Social Security this is not the time to cut the program This is a time to enhance the program so that all of our seniors especially those who were hit hardest by the epidemic How do we know this Of the more than 1 million people who passed away from the pandemic over 750 000 are over the age of 65 And who is impacted most by inflation Those people who are on a fixed income and by definition those on Social Security are on a fixed income and need our help the most during this time of inflation It impacts every single district in this country On average there are 147 000 Social Security recipients in every congressional district and to deny them the enhancements that they need during this inflationary time and during a time period when Congress has not enhanced the program in more than 52 years is long overdue
945	Mr Speaker for 46 days the Government of Azerbaijan has forcibly cut off 120 000 ethnic Armenians in the Republic of Artsakh They are cut off from the outside world Food has become scarce They have to ration even basic items Diapers and medicine supplies have become so low that Facebook pages are opening where residents are trying to find these items from their neighbors Residents are separated from their families on the other side of the border in Armenia including children who have been attending school or visiting families Azerbaijan has even gone so far as to cut off natural gas during the depth of winter A humanitarian crisis is brewing and we should act to prevent it Let s be clear about what this attempt is It is an attempt by Azerbaijan to force Artsakh s ethnic Armenian population out of their homes by making life in Artsakh impossible The tactic is blockade The effect is civilian deprivation The object is ethnic cleansing But don t take my word for it Listen to Azerbaijani dictator Aliyev who made his intentions clear when this blockade unfolded by saying Whoever does not want to become our citizen can leave What does he mean The ethnic Armenians are citizens They are citizens of the Republic of Artsakh but Aliyev doesn t recognize that citizenship and instead uses it as an excuse to say that he wants to ethnically cleanse these 120 000 people I am glad that Secretary Blinken earlier this week called on President Aliyev to end this blockade but we know that dictators don t often respond to calls for justice I urge the administration to put real weight behind these calls by making clear that there will be consequences to Azerbaijan by plunging the people of Artsakh into this humanitarian disaster including sanctions if necessary The administration should enforce section 907 to stop all military assistance to Azerbaijan and to provide critical humanitarian aid to the people of Artsakh actions that are long overdue Ever since I came to Congress almost 27 years ago I have introduced and fought for a resolution to recognize the Armenian genocide the first genocide of the 20th century Back then it was not uncommon for Members of this body to minimize or even deny the systematic ethnic cleansing and murder of 1 1 2 million Armenians Greeks or Syrians and others by the Ottoman Empire but Armenian Americans and their allies did not give up For decades they spoke truth to power and turned the political tide until the Armenian genocide was recognized by this House and then by President Biden It may have taken longer but we got there This is a painful moment for the Armenian community I am confident that the Armenian people will rise in strength Armenians have outlived those who said there was no Armenian genocide and they will outlive those who say there is no Artsakh I urge the Biden administration and all Members of this body to take a forceful stance against Azerbaijan s shameful attempts at ethnic cleansing of the Armenian population of Artsakh through this deadly blockade Debt Limit Crisis
946	Mr Speaker we have already hit the debt limit Republicans say they want to negotiate We negotiate about spending all the time What they really mean is that they want additional leverage by threatening this country with a default on our debt which would cost us according to Moody s Analytics 6 million jobs a 9 percent unemployment rate 15 trillion lost in our investment markets Already they are dillydallying with this debt limit Their playing Russian roulette with our economy has already hurt our economy As the chief Democrat on the Capital Markets Subcommittee I am here to tell you that the cost of capital is higher and projects are not going forward because of the actions they have taken so far They want to negotiate They want to negotiate going backward They want to negotiate reducing Social Security benefits They want spending cuts but they won t specify what they want If we are going to negotiate let s negotiate going forward Let s talk about increases in Social Security benefits let s negotiate getting rid of the 2 trillion of unjustified Trump tax cuts that went chiefly to corporations and the wealthy You want to negotiate Fine we will negotiate going forward but ultimately we will end up with a clean debt limit You can t just love your country when your guy is in the White House You can t play Russian roulette just because you don t like the President and you think that President will take the political hit We need to show the world that our governance in America is sound and that our economy is worthy of investment
947	Mr Speaker I rise today to highlight one of the crises that we are facing in our country and it is obvious to so many except unfortunately so many in this House that we have a crisis at our southern border We have not only seen over 4 7 million people cross illegally many of whom are claiming asylum despite not qualifying for asylum but we are also seeing record levels of fentanyl killing so many Americans each and every single day We must take a stand to secure our border to stop this flow of illegal drugs to stop this mass illegal migration When you talk about the number of 4 7 million when you think about the number of people who have actually evaded our government who have evaded any interaction with our law enforcement and CBP agents you are talking about 1 2 million people That is more than twice the size of Staten Island the borough in New York City I represent It is outrageous to think that we would have individuals entering our country illegally and we don t know what their intentions are where they are coming from why they are here That is what scares me the most as an individual who represents the city of New York We know that 98 suspected terrorists on our terrorist watch list crossed the border last fiscal year and we know so far this year there have been another 38 That should be alarming to every single person in this country We must know who is entering our country and what their intentions are To allow this amount of people to evade law enforcement to evade any interaction with our government is a very dangerous action on behalf of this administration House Republicans believe that Secretary Mayorkas has completely abdicated his responsibility to keep our country secure and we will be moving forward with hearings to expose what he is doing I do believe at the end of the day it warrants him being impeached and removed from his position Also I highlight how the Federal Government s lack of action at the border coupled with my State legislature s and Governor s horrible actions in New York have led to what we are seeing now in terms of a rise in crime First of all New York is dealing with major actions in terms of crime car thefts people being released In fact I just read yesterday that in my district a 20 year old guy who has been stealing cars is being released right back onto the streets It has been about three times The first time he was arrested it was for 20 counts of car theft Let s now look at what we are doing here When I went down to Federal Plaza and met with our ICE officials they are saying that New York City is not cooperating with any detainer requests for people who are criminals That means they either were convicted of a crime in their home country or were convicted of a crime here It is the worst of the worst in society that ICE is trying to remove from our country and our local officials won t cooperate I think it is outrageous that the city of New York continues to harbor people who are not only in this country illegally but are committing crimes on top of it Just the other day New York City residents found out that they are paying to house paying to feed paying to provide services to individuals who were shoplifting in our State Think about that Not only are they crossing into our country illegally but after committing crimes they were released back onto the street thanks to our State s ridiculous bail law and on top of it the taxpayers of the city of New York are paying to house and feed them How does that make any sense and how is that in the best interests of our citizens I am the daughter of immigrants I understand and appreciate the aspirations of the American Dream We need to work together to address what is happening at our border We need to work together to ensure that those legitimate asylum seekers are not getting stuck in the bureaucracy and the red tape because of those individuals who are here claiming asylum when they don t qualify We have to work on our visa system to ensure that we address the labor shortage We should have more visas employee sponsored visas and family sponsored immigration as well I look forward to working with my colleagues to secure our border Let s impose some common sense
948	In Iran a dangerous regime is harming its people stripping them of their rights and spreading lies to cover it up The world must know where we stand The Biden administration is leading the way and I strongly support their newly announced sanctions on some of the world s worst human rights abusers These offenders are top ranking officials in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps the regime s right hand in repression Sanctions also target the IRGC s business enterprise which has been funding the regime s brutality for decades The U S leadership was mimicked by the United Kingdom and European Union I applaud this unified response from our allies It is a clear rejection of Iran s violence and a demand for the Iranian people to be heard The struggles continue and we must all remember that Woman Life Freedom is not just a chant It is a call to action Clean School Bus Program
949	Mr Speaker I rise to speak up for California s children our communities and our environment The vast majority of American schoolbuses run on diesel a major source of pollution that contributes to the climate crisis As a result bus emissions worsen our air quality with significant harm around schools in residential areas and within the passenger cabin This is a serious problem for our environment and our children s health The bipartisan infrastructure law that I supported invests in a solution The Clean School Bus program funds 5 billion for the purchase of electric schoolbuses improving the air for our kids and our communities Electric buses also improve discipline reduce noise pollution and give schools budget certainty They can save school districts up to 80 percent on the cost of fuel maintenance and repairs However the Clean School Bus program unfairly targets California Even though our State has nearly 13 percent of schoolchildren and the second lowest busing rate in the country ahead only of Mississippi the law unfairly imposes a 10 percent State cap on the funds Even worse to date California has only gotten 7 33 percent of the Clean School Bus program funds Our State leads the Nation in transitioning to electric vehicles and reducing emissions We need our Federal Government to be a partner in these efforts California wants to invest in clean buses to take children to school to learn and to grow but we cannot do it alone If America is to be the global leader in transitioning to a clean energy economy we need to give every State including California their fair share of financial support The 69 5 million already invested in the Clean School Bus program in California provides some necessary help but it is not nearly enough to support our densely populated working class communities some of which have the worst air quality in the Nation I have seen firsthand the tremendous interest in the Clean School Bus program when my office hosted grant workshops with school districts and Tribal communities to share information about these Federal resources for acquiring low and zero emission schoolbuses To meet this moment we need a coordinated effort from Federal State and local entities to make the change California needs a leader who will fight to remove unfair roadblocks such as arbitrary State caps that limit investment in clean technology I will continue to push for a level playing field for California that invests our Federal tax dollars where the need is greatest and where they can do the most good
950	Mr Speaker there have been 40 separate mass shootings since the year began This weekend 18 people were murdered within hours of each other That is it That is all there is to say What do these mass murders all have in common Easy access to unregulated firearms That is the problem It cannot get any clearer Without easy access to unregulated firearms these mass murders do not happen these families do not grieve and this country does not live in fear Without easy access to unregulated firearms we save lives It is just that simple It is truly that simple This type of bloodshed doesn t happen in other developed nations around the world only here in the United States of America Other nations don t allow unfettered access to unregulated firearms This is not who we are supposed to be as America We should feel safe in our communities
951	Will the gentleman from South Carolina Mr Wilson come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance Mr WILSON of South Carolina led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all
952	Mr Speaker over the last few weeks California has experienced severe storms that brought much needed water to our State If you thought that meant water shortages in California were over you would be wrong Since October of last year California has flushed over 6 4 million acre feet of water out to the ocean That is 2 trillion gallons This is extremely frustrating for the Central Valley farmers who are fallowing their fields and the communities that are running out of water for daily use in their homes and businesses The pumps that are in place to deliver water to farms homes and businesses aren t allowed to run at their full capacity due to environmental regulations If we had increased flexibility on these pumping regulations to account for real time conditions we could have captured 84 000 more acre feet of water during the 2 weeks of storms Increasing flexibility in how we operate these pumps as well as investing in critical water storage infrastructure and conveyance projects will allow us to maximize what can be stored for these flow events and make us more resilient for drought Every drop of water is critical to my constituents in Central Valley
953	Mr Speaker in the decades long fight to end hunger last September s White House Conference on Hunger Nutrition and Health was a major turning point I thank the Biden Harris administration for convening antihunger and nutrition stakeholders from across America to come up with an ambitious yet achievable plan to end hunger and reduce diet related illnesses by 2030 The national strategy put forward will serve as our guide Now it is time to put plans into action I am thrilled that the Biden Harris administration remains laser focused on maintaining the momentum coming out of the conference We have already achieved big wins like permanently expanding summer food benefits for families with kids and signing into law the Food Donation Improvement Act a bill I championed to make it easier for businesses to donate food Our work is just beginning and I urge every American to join us in creating a healthier hunger free future for all I have more faith than ever that working together we can and will end hunger now
954	Mr Speaker last week President Biden decided to second guess law enforcement once again Last Monday he asked why they meaning the police should always shoot with deadly force In the past he has also told police officers to aim for the legs while criminals are charging at them These comments show a complete lack of knowledge of policing and self defense The fact is criminals will sometimes violently resist arrest In those instances it is important for police officers to be able to defend themselves or others around them Any time a firearm is discharged that is considered deadly force Is the President suggesting cops never use their firearms even in clear cases of self defense or protecting others To sit on the sidelines and blame law enforcement not criminals for the outcomes of these deadly interactions encourages violence against police officers excuses criminal behavior and is very bad for recruiting new police officers The President should be standing with our law enforcement officers not siding with or aiding and abetting criminals
955	Mr Speaker I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Larry Rogers Sr Larry was a loving father and grandfather and a devoted Chicago sports fan but he was known to many for changing their lives in the courtroom Larry was a native of the Roseland community in Chicago and came to the practice of law while he was working three jobs to support his family There were very few other Black attorneys at the time and Larry Rogers Sr helped pave the way for more lawyers who looked like him As a lawyer Larry fought for the little guy He won hundreds of millions of dollars for victims of corporate malfeasance and medical malpractice One of his most notable accomplishments was winning an eight figure verdict for victims of chloride deficient baby formula even after the Department of Justice declined to press charges He lived a life devoted to giving the powerless a chance to take on the most powerful Larry Rogers Sr leaves behind a legacy that all of Illinois can be proud of It was an honor to know him

957	Mr Speaker I rise today for my first floor speech to stand with women across the country to commemorate what should have been the 50th anniversary of Roe v Wade this past weekend This decision had guaranteed every woman and girl in our country the freedom to make decisions about their own bodies Yet 7 months ago our radical Supreme Court ripped that freedom away In today s America there are millions of women who won t be able to have a say in their own futures This came as a direct result of extremist Republicans and their decades long war on reproductive healthcare Instead of focusing and delivering for Americans Republicans have proposed and prioritized a national abortion ban Let s be clear Abortion is healthcare and abortion should be accessible to every woman in our country For this reason I rise today strongly in support of the Women s Health Protection Act to make Roe v Wade the law of the land

959	Mr Speaker how are House Republicans working for America s working families struggling to make ends meet By pursuing an economic scheme that raises their taxes and increases their everyday costs The very first bill that House Republicans passed was a break for tax cheats that also benefited large corporations and billionaires while adding 114 billion to the deficit Last time Republicans controlled the House they enacted a 2 trillion tax cut for the 1 percent and big corporations All the while House Democrats continue to work to hold large corporations accountable and ensure they are paying their fair share We are working to strengthen the middle class by creating good paying jobs lowering middle class taxes and protecting Social Security and Medicare because we understand that a strong middle class is essential to a strong economy to a strong democracy and to a strong America
960	Mr Speaker FOX News and Iran International report that the Special Envoy for Iran for Biden Robert Malley has met with the Iranian Ambassador to the United States three times recently During this period the Iranian regime was murdering its own people in the streets The Biden administration must explain to the American people what was discussed General Jack Keane has correctly warned that Iran can develop a nuclear capability in just 4 more months Biden refuses to close the door and stop the talks over reentering the Iran nuclear deal An absurd Iran nuclear agreement will give the regime billions of dollars threatening Israel and underwriting drones to Putin against Ukraine I have appreciated the bipartisan opposition to the deal by Senator Joe Lieberman and Chairman Eliot Engel The House Republican majority is committed to providing oversight of the weak foreign policy of Biden In conclusion God bless our troops who successfully protected America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues moving from the Afghanistan safe haven to America
961	Mr Speaker I am the Congressman who represents the great city of Memphis Right now much of the national media is looking at Memphis as there was an awful killing of a 29 year old African American man by five police officers within the last few weeks The five police officers have been fired by the police department for violating their oath The DA will announce charges in a few hours It could be a situation where people want to exercise their First Amendment rights to protest the actions of the police department and people should but they should be peaceful and calm We have a new DA we have a new U S Attorney and we have a new police director They are the right people at the right time to bring about reform and to deal with this case to see that justice is rendered I grieve for the life of Tyre Nichols whose life should not have been extinguished He was an outstanding young man and it is extremely sad that he was killed I pray for my city
962	Mr Speaker I rise to celebrate National School Choice Week School choice is about giving families the freedom to choose the best education possible for their children regardless of their learning style or home address or financial situation Every parent in America wants to give their child the best education possible and Nebraska has great options public private homeschools Not everyone has the means to access their option of choice I believe we should fund the students not the systems When funding for education follows students to the school of their choice families win Nebraska is one of only two States in the Nation that has not passed a school choice program I am excited about these opportunities and look forward to giving parents the choice
963	Mr Speaker I rise today to voice my concerns with the ongoing censorship of conservative voices We are all aware of the leftist bias and discrimination on social media The recent Twitter files tell a sinister tale of censorship and discrimination against conservatives and Republicans across the country But the campaign of censorship and discrimination by the left also extends to satellite and cable TV The Nation s largest satellite TV provider DIRECTV has threatened another conservative leaning cable news network First it was OAN a year ago and now DIRECTV has threatened to deplatform Newsmax the fourth largest cable news network Competition is the heart of the American economy but the mainstream media is an anti American institution that has no regard for the First Amendment rights of conservatives or protecting a platform for all viewpoints DIRECTV S actions are a clear effort to discriminate against conservative voices DIRECTV pays leftist outlets to carry their content on their satellite network but conservative outlets are not treated the same Many liberal channels with a fraction of Newsmax s audience receive payment from DIRECTV This bias is blatant and egregious and Congress should look into this censorship and address the discrimination against conservative voices
964	Mr Speaker I rise today to recognize and to encourage my longtime friend Alan Loving Alan serves as pastor for students and families at First Baptist Church of Madison Alan has dedicated his life as a minister of the Gospel and has impacted countless lives for eternity during his many years of service as a youth minister Recently Alan suffered a life changing accident that has left him paralyzed from the waist down We praise God for Alan s continued recovery and rehabilitation God s word tells us in Proverbs As iron sharpens iron so one man sharpens another Throughout this journey Alan and his family have been an inspiration to me and so many others throughout our community We have been sharpened by his strength and his faithfulness Mr Speaker I rise today to let Alan know that Mississippi loves him and his family We are praying for him his wife Courtney his daughters Mary Addison and Anna Claire We are inspired by his determination and faith
965	Mr Speaker the Biden administration continues to fail the American people Just last month Customs and Border Protection had 251 487 migrant encounters along the southern border the highest number of encounters ever recorded in a single month Despite our constant calls to get this crisis under control it has only gotten worse Either President Biden is trying and utterly failing or worse not trying at all Since President Biden has taken office there have been more than 4 5 million migrant encounters at our southern border and December marked the tenth straight month with more than 200 000 encounters a trend that has never been recorded before None of these statistics include the over 1 2 million known got aways who have evaded our overwhelmed U S Border Patrol agents Mr Speaker I rise for all middle Tennesseans to say Mr President please do your job and secure our border
966	Mr Speaker I rise today to honor my friend Chief Lou Dekmar from LaGrange Georgia on his well deserved retirement For 50 years Chief Dekmar has protected and defended our communities as a law enforcement officer He has long been a hero in the community protecting the lives of citizens as well as fellow officers Serving nearly 30 years as police chief in LaGrange Georgia Chief Dekmar s unwavering dedication to ensuring that the folks of Troup County stayed safe and secure was second to none Chief Dekmar embodies the true heart of a leader and his work to heal the community and establish racial reconciliation in the city were just a few of the many accomplishments he had throughout his decorated career Mr Speaker I thank him for his unbelievable devotion to serving the people of Georgia and congratulate him on a well earned retirement
967	Pursuant to House Resolution 5 and rule XVIII the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill H R 21 The Chair appoints the gentleman from North Carolina Mr Rouzer to preside over the Committee of the Whole In the Committee of the Whole Accordingly the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill H R 21 to provide for the development of a plan to increase oil and gas production under oil and gas leases of Federal lands under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Agriculture the Secretary of Energy the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Defense in conjunction with a drawdown of petroleum reserves from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve with Mr Rouzer in the chair
968	Pursuant to the rule the bill is considered read the first time General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the majority leader and the minority leader or their respective designees The gentlewoman from Washington Mrs Rodgers and the gentleman from New Jersey Mr Pallone each will control 30 minutes The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Washington Mrs Rodgers
969	Mr Chair I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr Chair I rise in support of H R 21 the Strategic Production Response Act Two weeks ago this body sent a strong message that we must ensure our Nation s Strategic Petroleum Reserve will not advance the energy interests of China over the energy security interests of Americans This bill today will help ensure this vital American energy asset and American security interests will not be drained away for nonemergency political purposes This bill is about restoring America s energy security It provides a path towards making energy more affordable for Americans who are looking to us to help ease the pain at the pump H R 21 does this by preserving the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for its vital and central purpose to provide the oil supplies Americans need during true emergencies emergencies like supply disruptions that threaten the Nation s economy or the loss of oil production due to hurricanes and other disasters Put simply under this bill if an administration chooses to use the reserve for nonemergency political purposes it will first have to develop a plan that an equal amount would be reinstated from American energy resources The SPR should be used as a tool of last resort This is sensible energy policy It is also urgent policy At present the SPR s ability to protect Americans has been put at risk More than 250 million barrels of oil approximately 40 percent of the reserve has been drawn down in less than 2 years This is more than all of the former Presidents in history combined It is all to cover up historically high gas prices in an election year This is irresponsible The Biden administration has undermined our Nation s ability to respond to true energy emergencies by mismanaging our Nation s strategic energy stockpile At the same time the administration has taken every action to suppress America s mighty energy production abilities Unbelievably the Biden administration has turned to Venezuela and Saudi Arabia to pump more oil instead of working to lift their regulatory restraints on American energy producers America s oil production and refining capacity remains 1 million barrels below peak levels during the prior administration We have the world s most abundant resources and the capacity to produce millions more barrels per day America should never be at the mercy of OPEC or Russia Energy security is economic security and it is national security It is all connected It is foundational to everything We should be unleashing American energy on all fronts Don t forget Mr Chair the United States has some of the highest environmental and labor standards in the world We have been the leader in bringing down carbon emissions We did this by embracing innovation and our abundant natural resources not by shutting down entire industries Right now America is suffering through the worst energy crisis in decades and gas prices are still surging upwards Now President Biden s and the Democrats radical rush to green agenda has made life unaffordable for people across the country It has driven up inflation it has strained household budgets and it has weakened our electric grid Gas prices have risen to the highest levels in history Some have been forced to pay more than 6 a gallon Gas prices are still 40 percent higher today and diesel prices are up almost 2 a gallon more than when President Biden took office It is time to flip the switch It is time to end the politically motivated abuse of the SPR and focus on American energy and American security Let s send a strong signal this Congress that we stand for energy security preserving the Strategic Petroleum Reserve restoring America s energy dominance and providing for the prosperity of all Americans Mr Chair I urge support of H R 21 and I reserve the balance of my time
970	Mr Chair I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr Chair I rise in opposition to H R 21 Once again House Republicans are showing their true colors bringing a bill to the floor that helps their Big Oil friends and hurts hardworking Americans This is a reckless and extreme bill It will hamstring the single most important tool the Biden administration has used to fight Putin s price hike on gasoline The chairwoman mentioned affordability but by releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve the Biden administration helped bring down gas prices by over 1 50 per gallon Republicans call that politicizing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve I call that providing real relief to the American people at the gas pump Again Democrats are addressing affordability trying to bring down high gas prices and now after promising to lower costs for American families House Republicans want to pass this bill that will raise gas prices at the pump Make no mistake Mr Chair that is exactly what this bill would do It would prevent the Department of Energy from using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to respond to price hikes until Big Oil is given open access to drill on public lands Restricting the Federal Government s best tool for decreasing gas prices in the middle of a global energy crisis defies any logic After all this is a tool that administrations of both parties Democrat and Republican have successfully used in the past It is baffling to me to see Republicans oppose President Biden s release of oil from the reserve considering that in recent years Republican administrations withdrew even more due to oil sales that they themselves mandated when they were in control of Congress House Republicans have also used the reserve as a piggy bank to withdraw nearly 300 million barrels of oil to pay for their priorities Yet now they want to feign outrage that President Biden withdrew fewer barrels to lower prices at the pump This is not serious legislation Mr Chair but instead a political stunt Republicans are just upset that President Biden stood up and actually used all the tools at his disposal to fight back against high gas prices for American families This bill actually fights against American families and against addressing affordability The Secretary of Energy was clear in a letter she wrote to Chair Rodgers and me last week Mr Chair I include in the Record the text of that letter The Secretary of Energy Washington DC January 18 2023 Hon Cathy McMorris Rodgers Chair Committee on Energy and Commerce House of Representatives Washington DC Hon Frank Pallone Jr Ranking Member Committee on Energy and Commerce House of Representatives Washington DC Dear Chair Rodgers and Ranking Member Pallone Congratulations again on your re elections to Congress and selections as Chair and Ranking Member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce I look forward to working closely with you in the 118th Congress I write to express the Department of Energy s serious concerns about H R 21 the Strategic Production Response Act From responding swiftly to natural disasters to executing a historic release of oil in response to Putin s invasion of Ukraine the Administration s use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve SPR has been critical to ensuring adequate oil supply and lowering gasoline prices for American families This bill would significantly weaken this critical energy security tool resulting in more oil supply shortages in times of crisis and higher gasoline prices for Americans Putin s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine created the worst global energy crisis in decades The President took unprecedented action with allies and partners releasing oil from our strategic reserves to stabilize global oil supply and gasoline prices We have heard directly from industry over the last several months that these actions were essential to maintaining supply And Americans see the results for themselves at the pump Today gasoline prices are down by 1 70 per gallon from their peak this summer In fact gasoline prices are now below where they were before Russia s invasion That was far from a foregone conclusion a year ago The Treasury Department estimates that the Administration s SPR actions reduced prices for American consumers at the pump by as much as 40 cents per gallon In addition to saving Americans money the SPR releases should provide a good deal for taxpayers by selling oil at a high price with a planned refill of the SPR at lower prices If enacted H R 21 would make it harder to take such action quickly to increase supply when the market needs it most driving up prices during crises H R 21 would significantly interfere with the United States ability to release oil collectively through the International Energy Agency during an emergency supply shortage as was done in early March 2022 And H R 21 would severely restrict the Department s ability to lend oil when disruptions occur due to natural disasters or pipeline outages Just last month when the Keystone Pipeline was suddenly shut down refiners in Texas and Louisiana were sent scrambling to keep facilities running This Administration like those of both parties have previously quickly lent out oil to help maintain operations avoid shortages and prevent further price spikes H R 21 would undermine our ability to take such decisive action in response to future disruptions I believe it is essential that the SPR can continue to address supply disruptions by rapidly providing oil in response to emergencies Arbitrarily requiring the completion of reports related to energy production on Federal lands a matter which the Department of Energy does not control would only delay such critical action and increase prices for Americans when energy disruptions occur Today there is nothing standing in the way of domestic oil production In fact oil production is up by 1 million barrels per day under President Biden and is on track to reach a new record high this year Oil and gas companies are currently sitting on approximately 9 000 approved but unused permits to drill and billions in record profits They do not need another giveaway I appreciate your consideration of these concerns and I hope we can work together on strategies to ensure American energy productivity security and affordability Sincerely Jennifer M Granholm
971	Mr Chair in that letter Secretary Granholm wrote that by hamstringing the administration this bill will result in more oil supply shortages in times of crisis and higher gasoline prices for Americans The President also recognizes this bill is a bad deal for the American people and that is why he said that he would veto it if it ever got to his desk Mr Chair I also include in the Record the text of the Statement of Administration Policy Statement of Administration Policy H R 21 Strategic Production Response Act Rep McMorris Rodgers R WA and 31 Cosponsors The Administration strongly opposes H R 21 the Strategic Production Response Act The bill would significantly weaken a critical energy security tool resulting in more oil supply shortages and higher gas prices for working families This Administration s use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve SPR has been essential to protecting our energy security and to lowering gas prices for Americans Following Putin s further invasion of Ukraine last year President Biden authorized the largest ever emergency release from the SPR in coordination with historic releases from allies and partners The results speak for themselves today gasoline prices are 1 60 per gallon lower than their peak this summer and below their pre invasion levels That was far from a foregone conclusion the Treasury Department estimates that SPR actions reduced prices at the pump by as much as 40 cents per gallon If enacted H R 21 would significantly weaken America s ability to take such decisive action to increase supply and lower prices in times of crisis Putin has tried to use energy supply and high prices as a strategy to weaken the United States and Europe s resolve to defend Ukraine By interfering with the United States ability to release oil collectively this legislation would help Putin s war aims In addition H R 21 would severely restrict the Administration s ability to increase oil supply and prevent price spikes in response to natural disasters or pipeline outages as Administrations of both parties have done By arbitrarily requiring completion of a report related to energy production on Federal lands H R 21 makes it harder to provide relief to Americans during energy disruptions globally and at home Moreover there is nothing currently standing in the way of domestic oil production Production is up by more than 1 million barrels per day under President Biden and is on track to reach a new record this year Oil and gas companies are currently sitting on thousands of unused but approved permits that they can use to further increase production right now Because H R 21 will jeopardize our energy security and increase gas prices for working families the Administration strongly opposes the bill If Congress were to pass this bill the President would veto it
972	Mr Chair it is frankly stunning that after about 2 years of Republicans talking such a big game on energy security and energy independence that one of the Republicans first bills this Congress is a proposal that would seriously undermine both The truth is that Republicans decades old drill baby drill mentality is outdated it is reckless and it simply cannot and will not protect Americans from the volatile price movements of a global commodity Our country has adopted this mentality for decades and it just doesn t work The United States is already the world s top producer of both oil and gas and the fossil fuel industry already controls large portions of U S public lands and waters and it isn t using most of it Right now fossil fuel companies control over 26 million acres of U S public lands half of which is going unused The problem is not a shortage of land or leases Republicans only want the American people to think that that is the case because they want to keep doing the bidding of Big Oil But the bottom line is Big Oil doesn t want to pump oil because that would lower prices They don t want to do it They don t want to address the issue of affordability with gas prices They don t want to pump more oil No matter how much we drill anyway doubling down on our fossil fuel dependency is exactly what has kept us dependent on the global market and this global market where we have oil from other countries is largely controlled by dictators and adversaries on the other side of the world So Mr Chair this bill is not serious It is yet another old tired one page bill that shows just how antiquated and misplaced Republican priorities are We should be spending our time on serious thoughtful proposals that actually address our energy challenges and opportunities that lower gas prices as opposed to raising them and to ensure that Americans and their jobs don t get left behind as the rest of the world transitions to clean energy Mr Chair if you really care about bringing down gas prices you would oppose this bill Mr Chair I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this bill and I reserve the balance of my time
973	Mr Chair I thank the chairwoman for yielding Mr Chair I rise today in support of H R 21 the Strategic Production Response Act Instead of unleashing America s vast domestic energy resources President Biden has hobbled our Nation s energy production resulting in fuel shortages and rising energy costs for all American families He went so far as begging foreign dictators for oil instead of uplifting America s economy It is worth noting that just a few short years ago America was energy independent House Republicans have made it clear that we are going to hold the Biden administration accountable for its actions As we sit here today President Biden is draining around 40 percent of our Strategic Petroleum Reserve The reserve was established to be used for national emergencies not for cheap political points or Band Aids for failed policies The Strategic Production Response Act would require the Biden administration to replenish and maintain the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and this legislation would require the Secretary of Energy to come up with a plan to replenish the reserve if oil is taken for nonemergency reasons The President has ample solutions in front of him to fix America s energy crisis In fact Republicans have been offering up long term energy solutions to the Biden administration but they refuse to listen Instead they have given in to the demands of left wing special interests and radical environmental groups and have left the American people stranded In America we do our part in making sure that the energy we produce is done in a cleaner and safer way than any other country on Earth Unleashing American energy is the solution to our Nation s energy crisis My message to President Biden is simple The days of taking shortcuts to cover up major policy failures are over H R 21 is an important step in holding the administration accountable for their actions and I am proud to support this legislation
974	Mr Chair I thank the gentleman for yielding I rise in strong opposition to H R 21 and I urge all my colleagues to oppose this big giveaway to Big Oil The bill before us today is yet another effort to open our public lands and waters to major new oil and gas extraction This is despite the fact that oil companies already control huge amounts of our public lands and waters most of which they don t even use Right now oil and gas companies have about 9 000 approved but unused permits across 26 million acres of public land Right now offshore they have 2 000 active leases covering 12 million acres three quarters of which aren t being used This bill asks us to give them even more land an area three times the size of California or more than 300 million additional acres Big Oil has more public land than they can use They could expand production today if they really wanted to Instead they lobby Congress to open up even more lands to extraction to lower environmental standards and to give them more taxpayer funded subsidies And in the process they lock out public land and public access from other essential uses that would contribute to the American people and contribute to the mitigation and remediation and the climate action that is required around the issue of climate and the climate crisis To add insult to injury this bill would actually make it harder to help everyday Americans It would prevent the President s ability to keep down gas prices Last year President Biden took decisive action allowing releases from the reserve to lower prices at the pump Under this bill if the President needed to act again to keep prices low he would first have to pay off Big Oil by opening up our public lands This bill does not protect the American people and it certainly doesn t protect our climate or environment Mr Chairman I urge my colleagues to vote no
975	Mr Chairman I support H R 21 Michiganians are facing hardships due to President Biden and Secretary Granholm s war on American energy My constituents are struggling to afford to fill up their tanks and heat their homes Instead of abandoning his failed progressive policies and unleashing domestic energy production to lower costs for hardworking Americans the Biden administration decided to use America s Strategic Petroleum Reserve as a political Band Aid President Biden has sold off over 250 million barrels of oil draining our SPR to its lowest level since 1983 America s Strategic Petroleum Reserve is to be used in cases of national emergency not political emergencies Energy security is national security H R 21 is a commonsense measure to ensure that our SPR remains ready for when we face global supply disruptions that threaten our economy and prevents politically motivated withdrawals Let s pass it
976	Mr Chairman I rise in opposition to H R 21 The Republican bill would cause higher gas prices It would hamstring the ability of the President to respond to a crisis It also would open up areas to drilling and pollution that should be off limits and it would exacerbate climate pollution and the costly related impacts ripping through America After Putin invaded Ukraine and American consumers were grappling with higher gas prices President Biden was right to release oil from the strategic reserve to cushion the economic blow to American families It was a commonsense strategy that helped lower gas prices for Americans Now Republicans want to tie the hands of the President to act when necessary There are too many contingencies in the world war supply chain issues natural disasters to irrationally tie the hands of the Commander in Chief to use the strategic reserve when needed This bill also opens up areas to drilling and pollution that should be off limits like the coast of Florida It could wreck our economy our beautiful coastal waters and beaches and areas that the Department of Defense needs for military training Plus it is completely unnecessary The oil and gas industry already controls large portions of public lands and waters They aren t using it They are sitting on approximately 9 000 approved but unused permits for drilling Finally this is dangerous and costly and will exacerbate the climate crisis The top scientists say we have a rapidly closing window to reduce climate pollution and avoid the worst impacts but Republicans have abdicated their responsibility to keep these costs in check for everyday Americans True energy security and independence will come through clean energy efficiency and innovation Twenty percent of electricity net generation in the U S right now comes from renewable sources With the Inflation Reduction Act and the bipartisan infrastructure law we are on track now to lower costs to create good paying jobs and to build safer healthier more resilient communities across the country This bill is an outrageous handout to polluters that will cost families and weaken energy security for America In this Republican House I guess Big Oil and the wealthy powerful special interests win while everyday Americans will pay more
977	Mr Chairman our energy security is under attack This administration has drained our Strategic Petroleum Reserve selling off 40 percent of the reserve in just the last 2 years The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is now at its lowest level in 40 years posing a threat to our country in the event of a real emergency Yet this administration has failed to implement even a simple plan to replace the Strategic Petroleum Reserve That is what this bill does With the Strategic Production Response Act Republicans are stepping up to the plate to ensure any nonemergency release is accompanied by a plan to increase the percentage of Federal lands and water leased for oil and gas exploration This is responsible This is common sense This bill is a critical step in unleashing our domestic energy production increasing our emergency supply and delivering on our promise to protect our Nation s energy security
978	Mr Chairman I rise in opposition to H R 21 If the beautiful wonderful Marvin Gaye were with us today he would say What s going on much more beautifully than I could say it This is what is going on This legislation is bad policy that will severely increase the price of gas at the pump destroy our environment and pollute and poison the air that our children and grandchildren deserve to breathe It will only help the rich get richer This bill could require the U S to open up over 300 million acres of Federal lands for new oil and gas drilling To put that into scale that is three times the size of the State of California Rather than curbing our dependence on fossil fuels and making America more energy independent my Republican colleagues are pushing legislation that will only increase our resilience on fossil fuels This bill is incredibly foolish and does nothing to address the real problems What are they really up to They want to put money into the pockets of Big Oil executives while taking it out of the pockets of everyday Americans So I ask what is the true intention of this legislation Who does this help Well I just told you It helps Big Oil and hurts everyday Americans because I know for damn sure it doesn t help the working families across our great country I remind my colleagues and all of us that we were elected to come here to this body to represent all Americans not just special interests Your bill will only line the pockets of your fossil fuel friends while making gas more expensive for everyday Americans This bill is shameful It fails our children and grandchildren and it fails to protect the American people
979	Mr Chair I rise today in support of H R 21 House Republicans are taking our next step to protect the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and put American energy dominance back on track First we are going to stop selling a national security tool to China and second we are going to leverage our domestic natural resources to protect against emergency supply disruptions The President s decision to exploit the SPR to cover up his own energy crisis was nothing short of a political stunt and I heard that word used when I first walked in After draining 40 percent of our reserve the President has left Hoosiers in Indiana s Sixth District vulnerable in the event of a true supply emergency The SPR is critical to helping respond to natural disasters hurricanes or severe supply disruptions It was never intended to be a solution to the Biden energy crisis facing Hoosiers and all Americans If the President was truly concerned about high energy prices he would work with Republicans to support the domestic resources we already have at our disposal H R 21 is a clear simple way to leverage our assets and refocus the SPR on its original intent responding to emergency supply disruptions I look forward to continuing our efforts on the Energy and Commerce Committee to hold this administration accountable and reestablish American energy dominance Mr Chair I urge support for this legislation
980	Mr Chair I rise in opposition to H R 21 My colleagues on both sides of the aisle know that as a Representative for the energy capital of the world in Houston I support domestic energy production We produce oil and gas better We have better environmental standards better worker safety standards and better emission reduction efforts and opportunities We know it is important to produce energy domestically for our economy and for our national security We also know that domestic production of oil and gas is a complicated system from upstream exploration and production to downstream refining and transportation along the way That is why I oppose this bill It doesn t reflect the reality of how oil and gas production works or solve the problem I think it seeks to solve Oil and gas production is a long and expensive process Leases are executed many years before production begins if it begins at all When we are talking about the Strategic Petroleum Reserve we are talking about crude oil that has been produced and stored for emergency use If what we are trying to do is make sure that the SPR is full and available we should pass legislation to require the government to replenish it after sales are made to buy when the price is low If what we are trying to do is increase domestic production we should be working on permitting reform and addressing issues in the capital markets that are making investments more difficult If operators can t make the investments build the infrastructure and move the product what good is a lease sale Today we have heard a lot of complaints about President Biden s strategic use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve which has successfully lowered the prices at the pump for Americans and weakened Russia s ability to fund its unprovoked unconscionable war against Ukraine It has been a vital tool as we just heard for responding to natural disasters and energy supply shocks and mitigating hostile foreign actors at other times We should support all of these efforts The response to this effort certainly should not be to make it harder to do what we have just successfully done That is what this bill does placing new burdensome requirements to offer vast sums of public lands for leasing at any time mandatory sales are dictated by Congress or exchanges are implemented by the Department of Energy It is not the solution that my friends on the other side of the aisle seem to think that it is and I would be glad to work with anyone here to address the real barriers to domestic energy production and support smart energy policy
981	Mr Chair I rise today in support of the Strategic Production Response Act The President sold an unprecedented amount of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve which was constructed to be used solely during national emergencies I regret that the President has instead used it as a political tool to attempt to lower gas prices Perhaps the most frustrating thing is this administration s constant demonization not just of fossil fuels but of the very men and women who work so hard to produce them It is vital for a business to have regulatory certainty to ensure price stability and President Biden s lack of guidance has created the most unclear times for the energy industry in modern history You can t attack the oil and gas industry say you want to put them out of business and then complain when gas prices go up It is critical for the SPR to be accessible to the most vulnerable citizens at times of crisis wildfires flooding tornadoes and hurricanes All over the country including in my home of Utah there are abundant fossil fuels that can be cleanly and responsibly developed on Federal lands that could be used to replenish the SPR for times of real crisis This is why I urge my colleagues to support this legislation
982	Mr Chairman I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against the so called Strategic Production Response Act which would significantly weaken our critical energy security This bill before us would result in more oil supply shortages higher gas prices for hardworking middle class families and jeopardize our energy security just so those on the other side of the aisle can do the bidding of their friends at Big Oil Big Oil has already received billions of dollars in taxpayer funded subsidies They enjoyed record shattering profits and it is all at the expense of hardworking families Today families live paycheck to paycheck that is the reality There is no thought for what this will do to the prices at the pump for families Big Oil has more than 26 million acres under lease and over 50 percent are nonproducing It is not because they are not allowed to drill More than 9 500 permits to extract oil were approved in 2021 alone While the administration has paused wasteful lease sales the permitting process for already leased lands continues The greed of Big Oil just never ends It inflicts pain and it inflicts financial instability on working families It is a daily assault There is an old saying Know where you stand and stand there Well it is clear where some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle stand and that is protecting Big Oil which has a monopoly and they can do what they want in terms of raising prices or lowering prices and they never lower prices I will continue to stand with the American people I urge my colleagues to vote against H R 21
983	Mr Chairman I thank the gentlewoman for yielding This legislation let s explain this very simply is necessary because we need to install the guardrails to protect the strategic reserve Before this administration it was unimaginable that a President would declare war on American energy That is why we are bringing this legislation forward to ensure that our Strategic Petroleum Reserve is being used only for emergencies and not to score cheap political points Any plan that uses this reserve outside of a national emergency must have a corresponding plan to backfill our stores It is unacceptable to cancel projects like the Keystone XL pipeline strip away American energy jobs and harass our energy producers while also using up our emergency supplies Americans cannot afford for the White House to play political games We need to lower prices at the gas pump for the Pennsylvania families that I represent Using our emergency supplies is unsustainable and actually it is reckless We cannot afford to waste any more time holding up permits and creating complicated regulations that only slow down production It is time to return to American energy dominance and use the resources that are under the feet of my constituents I urge all of my colleagues to vote yes on this important legislation
984	Mr Chairman I thank the gentleman for yielding Mr Chairman I rise today in strong opposition to H R 21 A poll was released today that 73 percent of Americans think that the Republican leadership has the wrong priorities and today we consider a bill which demonstrates how true those poll results are With this bill the Republicans are giving a big wet kiss to Big Oil They are making it more difficult for families to afford gas at the pump and rewarding Big Oil with record profits Once again they are demonstrating they care more about protecting the profits of Big Oil than protecting the wallets of hardworking Americans This legislation would make it impossible or nearly impossible for the President to lower gas prices by tying releases from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to this notion of expanding leasing on Federal lands which would make it almost impossible as Mrs Fletcher explained just moments ago Linking releases from the reserve to increases in drilling on Federal lands will result in higher prices for Americans and an exacerbation of the climate crisis already facing our country What is more startling is this isn t even necessary There are over 9 000 leases available right now where drilling is not taking place Why Because Big Oil wants to keep the price up high to maximize their profits and continue to gouge the American consumers Let s not continue to help them to do that The President was very wise to strategically use that reserve to lower the price at the pump I urge all my colleagues not to embrace this crazy idea of protecting the profits for Big Oil gouging our constituents with higher gas prices worsening the climate crisis and instead focus on the priorities of the American people to lower the cost of goods to lower the cost of gas at the pump to lower the cost of food at the grocery store That is what Republicans ran on Mr Chairman and their first act was to gut the IRS to make it harder for people to get their tax returns back and today they are trying to protect Big Oil and make it more expensive for our constituents Vote no
985	Mr Chairman I yield myself such time as I may consume When President Biden was inaugurated in January of 2021 gas prices were 2 33 a gallon I doubt you can find that anywhere in America today 2 33 a gallon They have only gone up since then The war on Ukraine did not cause the energy crisis it just exposed what was going on Refining and production is down a million barrels from when President Biden was elected There has been the shutting down of American energy It is time to unleash American energy Mr Chairman I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia Mr Carter a leader on the Energy and Commerce Committee
986	Mr Chairman I rise in support of H R 21 because what President Biden and this administration have done with our Strategic Petroleum Reserve is nothing short of abuse What is worse is that the administration has drained our SPR to bribe the American people into forgetting about the failure of its policies Since day one the President and his administration have waged a war against our energy independence and security When to no one s surprise prices rose to the highest they have been in a generation instead of reversing course they doubled down and tried to pay off the American people by emptying the Strategic Petroleum Reserve I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill and I sincerely hope all of my colleagues on the floor support it today This bill not only limits the President s ability to abuse the SPR as he has done in the past 2 years but it also requires the administration to have a plan to increase production if it does pull from the SPR outside of our emergencies This is energy security and it is sorely needed in today s uncertain world
987	Mr Chairman replenishing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is in our national security interest but handing out 10 percent of our federally protected lands is not the answer Big Oil sits on more than 9 000 unused permits for drilling on public lands That is 9 9 million acres 7 5 million football fields more land than Maryland and Delaware combined Congress should find the political courage to hold the fossil fuel industry accountable As long as Big Oil holds on to thousands of unused permits it shouldn t get a single acre more of our land We can strengthen our energy independence without another sweetheart deal for the fossil fuel industry which also receives billions in subsidies and without selling out the hunters fishers and hikers who rely on public lands and contribute 1 9 percent of our GDP I urge my colleagues to vote no on H R 21
988	Mr Chairman I rise today to stress the importance of maintaining our Strategic Petroleum Reserve The Biden administration has recklessly handled our SPR and made us more vulnerable economically and defensively They have drained the reserve by almost 40 percent with no plan to replenish it jeopardizing our economy and our national security America is currently unprepared for a true emergency forcing us to beg for oil from countries like Venezuela We are also more vulnerable to an energy supply disruption caused by natural disasters like hurricanes H R 21 would ensure that the administration has a plan in place to increase domestic energy production and to replenish the SPR Democrats want you to believe that draining the SPR is the only way to combat prices Wrong We can produce our own oil and gas Americans have suffered enough under the left s failed Green New Deal I encourage my colleagues to support H R 21 I also encourage them to support Representative Gaetz s amendment to ensure the important Gulf Test Range remains a pillar of our military readiness
989	Mr Chairman I rise today in opposition to H R 21 the Strategic Production Response Act H R 21 is unnecessary and it is harmful legislation that will have devastating consequences for hardworking American families and its impact on our environment will resonate for generations to come My district is home to the Cuyahoga Valley National Park which receives more than 2 2 million visitors every year Under H R 21 this irreplaceable national park and others across the Nation could be subjected to unnecessary oil and gas drilling devastating ecosystems our environment our economy and our communities Our National Park System plays an essential role in the advancement of our communities They create jobs strengthen the local economy contribute to local infrastructure development and help to conserve the natural environment cultural assets and traditions that we hold dear H R 21 is not a comprehensive strategic legislative undertaking that puts the needs of hardworking Americans first in fact it does the opposite Therefore Mr Chairman I cannot support this wholly unnecessary and harmful legislation in its current form and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote no
990	Mr Chairman I rise in support of H R 21 President Biden true to his word of a war on fossil fuels sold off an unprecedented 250 million barrels of oil in less than 2 years which is more than 40 percent of the stockpile Two of the four SPR sites along the Gulf Coast are now dangerously low on oil leaving America more vulnerable to a true energy supply disruption caused by hurricane or natural disaster Mr Chairman this issue is very personal to me and to my Gulf Coast district We house 60 percent of the Nation s SPR So when I say personal I mean it Mr Chairman I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill to prevent further abuse of the SPR
991	Mr Chairman energy security is national security Both sides recognize this and that is why we have a Strategic Petroleum Reserve to begin with The President s idea of strategy means using the SPR to bail him out for his disastrous energy policies In less than 2 years President Biden and his administration have drained 250 million barrels from the SPR You are going to hear that over and over again today Guess what Gas prices are still over 40 percent higher today than they were before the President took office Americans are suffering through the worst energy crisis in decades To make matters worse the SPR once the largest stockpile of fuel anywhere in the world is now at its lowest level since 1984 It is time to end this madness and commit to replenishing the SPR and Republicans have a plan to do that Our legislation would tie any future nonemergency drawdowns from the SPR to a concrete plan of action to increase oil and gas production on Federal lands The bottom line is this administration needs a plan to refill our SPR Quite frankly it is a dereliction of duty that they do not have a plan to restore our energy security
992	Mr Chair I rise in support of H R 21 the Strategic Production Response Act led by our Energy and Commerce Committee Chair McMorris Rodgers I am proud to cosponsor and support this bill which holds the Biden administration and future administrations accountable for misusing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Under President Biden s watch the stockpile has been depleted by an alarming 40 percent falling to its lowest level since 1984 Established in 1975 the SPR was intended to respond to national emergencies and to address severe supply disruptions not to manipulate gas prices This bill is quite simple It requires the Secretary of Energy to submit a plan to increase domestic energy production with any nonemergency drawdown of the SPR Despite falsehoods from the members of the President s own Cabinet this legislation provides clear exceptions for legitimate energy supply interruptions and only applies to nonemergency sales The American people want affordable reliable and sustainable energy for America not short term political gimmicks Mr Chairman I urge my colleagues to support H R 21
993	Mr Chairman I yield myself 1 minute I can t help but comment on the fact that my Republican colleagues continue to get up and criticize President Biden for releasing crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve I have to point out that Republican Presidents have done this many times in the past and I think the only reason why they are criticizing President Biden is because they know it worked We know that since last June when the gas prices were at their high for the season since the release the prices have gone down by 1 50 per barrel with all kinds of evidence to show that a significant reason for that was because of releasing crude oil from the reserve Now if you don t feel that is something that we should do you can say it but the bottom line is as Democrats we were trying and the President was trying to address an affordability issue The American people don t want to have to pay high prices for gas and they should not have to if we can do something about it Mr Chairman I reserve the balance of my time
994	Mr Chairman I rise today on behalf of the 2 million hardworking Texans the 10 million hardworking Americans that the President has told their job doesn t matter putting food on the table doesn t matter mortgage payments don t matter grocery bills don t matter I am actually shocked that this is a partisan issue that we have my Democrat colleagues that are saying that we don t want to refill an SPR or we don t want to consider it an emergency use only for political emergencies The President campaigned on a promise to end fossil fuels and he has pushed his failed policies from day one including the cancellation of Keystone XL telling 10 million workers who provide the energy our Nation so desperately needs that he doesn t want them to produce In fact not only does he not want them to produce he is going overseas begging global oil cartels for more energy These policies are completely disconnected from reality We are now facing rolling blackouts where families in the middle of the night may not have energy In places like California that is standard practice However now you have to consider it in Pennsylvania and Ohio and everywhere else Why Where are my Democrat colleagues who believe in affordable reliable energy Where are my colleagues who want to ease the burden of inflation that the President has caused This Republican majority knows and is in touch with the reality that every family is facing choices inflationary choices and it starts with energy I am proud to work alongside Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers to restore energy security President Biden s use of the SPR for his own political emergencies is unacceptable and we are now standing up to return the SPR to its rightful use for national security emergencies not fabricated political emergencies It is time for the President to join the Permian Basin for the President to join every State in using this for what it was designed to be used for It is a shame that my Democrat colleagues will not stand up for a national security imperative We must let our producers produce do what they do best and keep government out of it
995	Mr Chairman I yield myself 1 minute Mr Chairman again in response to the previous speaker who criticized the President the President successfully used the SPR to lower prices at the pump and provide relief to American families Now Republicans want to take away the strategy which will only result in higher gas prices for Americans The President s strategy worked and thanks largely to his actions gas prices have fallen an average of 1 50 per gallon nationwide since their peak in June President Biden s actions also made money for American taxpayers A Wall Street Journal analyst found that the United States made nearly 4 billion in profit from Biden s sale from the reserves receiving an average of 96 cents per gallon of oil sold from it well above the current market price of approximately 82 per barrel The Department of Energy has already announced plans to purchase oil to refill the reserve and will begin making those purchases at a low fixed price later this month They have actually made money lowered prices for the American consumer and are going to be able to fill the SPR at a lower cost Mr Chairman I reserve the balance of my time
996	Mr Chair if you bought gas recently you would be aware gas prices are up 40 cents just in the last couple of weeks Our reserve is drained We need to pass this bill Mr Chair I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Iowa Mrs Miller Meeks a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee
997	Mr Chair I thank Chairwoman Rodgers for yielding me time I rise in support of H R 21 an important and timely bill and I am proud that the new Republican majority made this one of our first priorities In less than 2 years President Biden has drained our Strategic Petroleum Reserve putting American energy security at risk Thankfully House Republicans have a plan to address the issue replenish our reserve and unleash American energy The President s energy policies have hurt Americans and I thank my colleague on the other side of the aisle He is correct In releasing oil from the SPR it may have helped to lower gasoline prices however it uncloaked the lie that it was price gouging from oil companies that caused prices to rise to begin with More supply was needed that was obvious and this administration s policies had constrained domestic production and supply Approximately 40 percent of the SPR has been drawn down since President Biden took office with no plan to replenish it Instead of working together to address the issue the President has indeed chosen to peddle a false narrative about our efforts The President claims our bill the Strategic Production Response Act would limit the administration s access to the SPR This is blatantly false Our bill specifically reinforces a President s ability to tap the SPR if an energy emergency is declared Our bill would however require the Department of Energy to prepare a plan to encourage domestic production if the SPR is tapped without a declared energy emergency While we may accept the seriousness of climate change we do not accept that U S energy transmission and restructuring of the entire industrial base is the solution Energy security is national security and failing to increase energy production and replenish the Strategic Petroleum Reserve puts our country at risk We need to unleash American innovation and energy production and set our country on a path to energy independence Mr Chair I urge my colleagues to vote yes on H R 21
998	Mr Chairman I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr Chairman the administration may have temporarily artificially reduced gas prices Up until election day they were selling a million barrels per day out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve They have now drained the reserve leaving us vulnerable and gas prices are on their way up again since Christmas 40 cents just since Christmas Mr Chairman I reserve the balance of my time
999	Mr Chairman I yield myself 1 minute The previous speaker prior to the ranking member mentioned supply and I want to read sections of the letter from Secretary Granholm about this that everyone received She says Putin s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine created the worst global energy crisis in decades The President took unprecedented action with allies and partners releasing oil from our strategic reserves to stabilize global oil supply and gasoline prices We have heard directly from industry over the last several months that these actions were essential to maintaining supply If enacted H R 21 would make it harder to take such action quickly to increase supply when the market needs it most driving up prices during crises I believe it is essential that the SPR can continue to address supply disruptions by rapidly providing oil in response to emergencies Arbitrarily requiring the completion of reports related to Federal lands a matter which the Department of Energy does not control would only delay such critical action and increase prices for Americans when energy disruptions occur Today there is nothing standing in the way of domestic oil production Mr Chairman I reserve the balance of my time
